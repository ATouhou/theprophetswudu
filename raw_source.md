THE EXCELLENCE OF WUDOO
=======================

1. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllahu'anhu) said: Rasoolullah
  (sallallaahu'alaihi wa sallam) said: **Shall I not guide you to that
  by which Allah wipes away the sins and raises the ranks?** They
  said: Certainly O Messenger of Allah! He said **Completing the
  wudoo when it is a hardship, and many steps to the mosques and
  waiting for the \[next\] Prayer after the Prayer, that is
  'ar-Ribaat' (defending the frontiers), that is 'ar-Ribaat' that is
  'ar-Ribaat').** \[Reported by Muslim (1/151) and others\].

2. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllahu'anhu) reports that Rasoolullah
  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said **When the Muslim (or
  'Believing') servant makes wudoo and washes his face then the sin of
  everything he looked at with his eye comes away with the water, or
  with the last drop of the water, and when he washes his hands then
  the sin of everything he stretched out his hands to comes away with
  the water, or with the last drop of the water. And when he washes
  his feet every sin which his feet walked towards comes away with the
  water or with the last drop of the water - so that he leaves clean
  (clear/pure) from sins.** \[Reported by Muslim (1/148) and others\].

3. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllahu 'anhu) reports that Rasoolullah
  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) came to the graveyard and said
  **Peace be upon you, dwelling of Believing People and we will (all)
  if Allah wills join you soon. I would have liked to have seen our
  brothers!** They said: Are we not your brothers, O Messenger of
  Allah? He said **You are my Companions and our brothers are those
  who have not yet come!** They said: How will you know those who have
  not yet come from your Ummah, O Messenger of Allah? He said **Have
  you not seen that if a man had a horse with a white blaze and hoof
  along with a totally jet-black horse, then would he not know his
  horse?** They said: Certainly, O Messnger of Allah. He said **So
  they will come with white blazes and marks from the wudoo and I am
  present before them at the Hand ('water-tank') Indeed men will be
  driven away from my 'water-tank' as the lost camel is driven away
  from their gathering place. 'Come on'. So it will be said: 'Indeed
  they have made changes after you,' so I will say: Be off, be off.**
  \[Muslim 249\].

4. Abu Umaamah (radhiAllahu'anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) said **When a Muslim makes wudoo the sins he has
  committed come away from his hearing and from his sight and from his
  hand and from his feet, so when he sits he sits down having been
  forgiven.** \[Reported by Ahmad (5/252) and is hasan\].

5. Abu Maalik al-Ash'aree (radhiAllahu anhu) said: Rasoolullah
  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) said **Purification is half of Imaan.
  And 'al-hamdu lillaah' fills the Scales. And 'subhaanAllah' and
  'al-hamdu lillaah' fill whatever is between the heaven and the
  earth. And Prayer is a light. And Sadaqah is a clear proof. And Sabr
  (patience) is a shining light. And the Qur'aan is a proof for or
  against you. Every person starts the day dealing for his own soul so
  he either sets it free or destroys it.** \[Reported by Muslim
  (1/140) and others\].

6. 'Uthmaan (radhiAllahu 'anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi
  wa sallam) said **Whoever makes wudoo and makes it well, his sins
  come out from his body, even coming out from under his nails.**
  \[Reported by Muslim (3/133) and others\].

7. 'Uthmaan (radhiAllahu 'anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi
  wa sallam) said **Whoever makes wudoo like this - then all of his
  previous sins are forgiven - and his Prayer and his walking to the
  mosque are above and beyond that.** \[Reported by Muslim, 3/113\].

8. Ibn 'Umar (radhiAllahu 'anhumaa) said: Rasoolullah
  (sallallaahu'alaihi wasallam) said **When one of you makes wudoo and
  makes it well, then goes out to the mosque - having no purpose
  except Prayer - then his left foot continues to wipe away his evil
  deeds and his right foot continually writes for him good deeds until
  he enters the mosque. And if the people knew what there was in the
  night prayer and Subh prayers - then they would come to them even if
  they had to crawl.** \[Reported by at-Tabraanee in 'al-Mu'jam ul-
  Kabeer'. And Ash-Shaikh al-Albaanee declares it to be saheeh
  (As-Saheehah, no.454). And its meaning is reported by al-Bukhaaree
  and Muslim from the narration of Abu Hurairah\].

9. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllahu'anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) said **Whoever makes wudoo and makes it well then
  goes out - and then finds that the people have finished the Prayer -
  then Allah gives him the same reward as one who had prayed it along
  with the people without diminishing any of their reward.**
  \[Reported by Abu Dawood (no.564) and an-Nasaa'ee (no.856) and
  others. Al-Albaanee declares it to be 'saheeh' (As-Saheehah,
  no.6039)\].

10. Zaid ibn Khaalid al Juhanee (radhiAllahu'anhu) relates that the
  Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said **Whoever makes wudoo
  and makes it well, then prays two rak'ahs not letting his mind
  wander in them - then Allah forgives him all of his previous
  sins.** \[Reported by Abu Dawood (no.905) and others. Al-Albaanee
  declares it to be 'hasan' (As-Saheehah, no.6041)\].

11. 'Uqbah ibn 'Aamir (radhiAllahu 'anhu) said: Rasoolullah
  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said **Whoever makes wudoo and makes
  it well, then prays two rak'ahs concentrating therein with his heart
  and his face - then Paradise is obligatory for him.** \[Reported by
  an-Nasaa'ee. Al-Albaanee declares it to be 'saheeh' (As-Saheehah,
  no.6062)\].

12. 'Uthmaan (radhiAllahu 'anhu) said: I heard Rasoolullah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) say **Whoever makes wudoo for Prayer and
  completes the wudoo - then walks to the obligatory Prayer and prays
  it with the people - or with the congregation - or in the mosque -
  then Allah forgives his sins.** \[Reported by Muslim (1/144) and
  others\].

13. 'Alee (radhiAllahu 'anhu) relates that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) said **Completing the wudoo when it is a
  hardship, and walking to the mosque, and waiting for the next prayer
  after the previous one (greatly) washes away the sins.** \[Reported
  by al-Haakim (1/132) who declared it to be saheeh to the standard of
  Muslim. And al-Haithumee said in 'Az-Zawaa-id': It is narrated by
  Abu Ya'laa and al-Bazzaar. And its narrators are up to the standard
  of Al-Bukharee\],

14. Humraan ibn Abaan relates that 'Uthmaan asked for water to make
  wudoo - then he mentioned how the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) made wudoo . Then he said: The Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi
  wa sallam) said at the end of the hadeeth

 **Whoever makes wudoo in the same way that I have just made wudoo then
 stands up and prays two rak'ahs, not thinking of other things, then
 his previous sins are forgiven.** \[Related by al-Bukhaaree (Fath
 ul-Baaree, 11/213) and Muslim (no.226) and an-Nasaa'ee ( 1/63)\] .

THE COMPONENTS OF WUDOO
=======================

 An Niyyah (Intention) This is the firm resolve of the heart to perform
 wudoo in obedience to the order of Allah ta'ala and His Messenger
 (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam). Ibn Taimiyyah (rahimahullaah) said
 (Majmoo'at-ur-Rasaa-il il-Kubraa 1/243): "The place of the niyyah is
 the heart and not the tongue in all forms of 'ibaadah - and that is
 agreed upon by all the Muslim scholars - Purification, Prayer, Zakaat,
 Sawm, Hajj, 'Itq (freeing of slaves), Jihaad, etc. If he were to
 express with his tongue other than that which he intended in his heart
 - then what he intended is counted, not what he said. If he voiced the
 intention with his tongue and the intention was not in his heart, that
 will not count - by total agreement of all the scholars of Islaam - so
 the niyyah is the firm intention and resolve itself."

1. As Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) himself explained in
  the hadeeth narrated by 'Umar (radhiAllahu 'anhu) in the Sahihain
  Verily the actions are by intention and there is for everyone only
  what he intended... \[Fath-ul-Baaree, 1/9, and Muslim, 6/48\].

AT-TASMIYYAH (MENTIONING ALLAAH'S NAME)
=======================================

1. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllahu' anhu) said that Rasoolullah (sallallahu
  'alaihi wasallam) said **There is no wudoo for him who does not
  mention Allah's name upon it.** \[Reported by Ibn Maajah (no.399),
  At-Tirmidhee (no.26), Abu Dawood (no.101) and others. Ash-Shaikh
  al-Albaani says: hadeeth Saheeh (Saheeh ul-Jaarni', no.7444)\].

 Imam Ahmad in one of his two sayings is of the opinion that it is
 obligatory in wudoo, ghusl, and Tayammum. He was followed in this
 opinion by Abu Bakr, and it is the saying of al-Hasan (al-Basaree) and
 Imam Ishaaq - as reported by Ibn Qudaamah in 'al-Mughnee' (1/84) and
 their proof is this hadeeth.
 
 Ibn Qudaamah adds: If we take the saying that it is obligatory, then
 the wudoo of one who deliberately leaves it is not correct as he has
 left an obligatory duty in Purification - just as if he had left the
 intention; and if he left it forgetfully then his purification is
 correct. (Al-Mughnee). And this is the saying that we regard as being
 correct.
 
 As for Ibn Taimiyyah (rahimahullah) he held it to be obligatory if the
 related hadeeth was authentic - as occurs in his Kitaab-ul-Imaan - and
 the hadeeth is authentic, so therefore his opinion (rahimahullah) is
 that it is obligatory.

1. Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim report from Anas (radhiAllahu 'anhu) that
  some of the Companions of the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) sought water for wudoo , so Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi
  wa sallam) said **Does any of you have water?** So he put his hand
  into the water and said **Make wudoo in the name of Allah.** And I
  saw the water coming out from between his fingers until they all
  made wudoo .

 Thaabit said: "I said to Anas (radhiAllahu'anhu): How many were
 there? He said: About seventy. \[Al-Bukhaaree, 1/236, Muslim, 8/411,
 An-Nasaa'ee, V8\].
 
 As for the proof for that which we have stated - it is his
 (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) saying **Make wudoo in the name of
 Allah.** As for those who say that it is only sunnah mu'akkadah then
 they base that upon the relative hadeeth being da'eef ( There is no
 wudoo ... ). However since the hadeeth is saheeh as we have explained,
 then there remains no proof for them and the proof is with us, and
 Allah Knows Best.
 
 So it is therefore obligatory as we have shown, however the one who
 forgets should mention Allah's name when he remembers.

WASHING THE HANDS
=================

1. Humraan (radhiAllahu'anhu) narrates that 'Uthmaan called for water
  to make wudoo and washed his hands three times... then said: I saw
  Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam)make wudoo just as I have
  made wudoo . \[Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, and as preceded\].

2. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllahu'anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) said **When one of you awakes from sleep then let
  him not enter his hand into the bowl/vessel until he washes it three
  times as he does not know where his hand has spent the night.**
  \[Al-Bukhaaree (Fath ul-Baaree, 1/229), Muslim and it is his
  wording, as al-Bukhaaree doesn't report "three times"\].

3. And in the hadeeth of'Abdullaah ibn Zaid (radhiAllahu'anhu) he was
  asked about the wudoo of the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam), so he called for a bowl of water and made wudoo from it as
  the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo, and he
  poured out water from the bowl upon his hand and washed it three
  times. \[Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath, l/255), Muslim, 3/121\].

4. Aus ibn Abi Aus reports from his grandfather (radhiAllahu 'anhu)
  who said: I saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) make
  wudoo washing his hands three times. \[Ahmad (4/9), An-Nasaa'ee
  (1/55) - with saheeh isnaad\].

 Al-Madmadah and Al-Istinshaaq AL-MADMADAH: Is washing the mouth and
 moving the water around within it.
 
 AL-ISTINSHAAQ: Is taking water into the nose and breathing it into its
 backmost part.
 
 AL-ISTINTHAAR: Is expelling the water from the nose after istinshaaq.

WASHING THE MOUTH AND NOSE TOGETHER WITH ONE HANDFUL (OF WATER)
===============================================================

1. 'Abdullaah ibn Zaid al-Ansaaree said that it was said to him:
  Perform for us the wudoo of Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam), so he called for a pot of water..until he said: So he
  washed his mouth and nose with a single handful and did that three
  times. \[Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim\].

WASHING THE MOUTH
=================

1. In the hadeeth of 'Amr ibn Yahyaa (radhiAllahu 'anhu) he said: And
  he washed his mouth and nose using three handfuls of water.
  \[Muslim, 3/123\].

 Al-Imam an-Nawawi says: And in this hadeeth is a clear proof for the
 correct opinion that the sunnah in washing the mouth and nose is that
 it should be with three handfuls of water - washing the mouth and nose
 \[together\] with each of them.

1. In the hadeeth of'Aa'ishah (radhiAllahu'anhaa) in which she
  describes the wudoo of the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam)
  that he said **When you make wudoo then wash your mouth.**
  \[Al-Baihaqi says: 'Its isnaad is saheeh.' And it contains an
  addition to the previous hadeeth of 'Aa'ishah in Abu Dawood,
  no.l43\].

WASHING THE NOSE AND EXPELLING THE WATER
========================================

1. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllahu'anhu) narrates that the Prophet
  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said **When one of you makes wudoo
  then let him enter water into his nose, then expel it.**
  \[Al-Bukhaaree (al-Fath, 1/229), Muslim (no.237), Abu Dawood (no.
  140)\].

2. Exerting in sniffing in the water as long as you are not fasting is
  reported in the hadeeth of Laqeet (radhiAllahu 'anhu) who said: O
  Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam), inform me of the wudoo
  . He said **Complete the wudoo and rub between the fingers and exert
  in breathing in the water into the nose unless you are fasting.**
  \[Abu Dawood, no.l42; At-Tirmidhee, no.38; An-nasaa'ee, no.ll4;
  IbMaajah, no.407; and others\]. (Declared as saheeh by Ibn Hibbaan
  and al-Haalcim, and adh-Dhahabee agreed to that. Also declared as
  saheeh by Ibn al Qaataan, An- Nawawi and Ibn Hajr. Refer to the
  footnote in al-Baghawi's Sharh us-Sunnah: 1/417\].

 It is clear from these two ahaadith that washing the mouth and nose
 are both obligatory (waajib). Ibn Qudaamah says in 'al-Mughnee':
 Washing the nose and washing the mouth are both obligatory in both
 forms of purification - Ghusl and wudoo - as washing the face is
 obligatory in both of them in the established view of the madhhab; and
 it is the saying of Ibn al-Mubaarak, Ibn Abi Lailaa and Ishaaq, and it
 is reported from 'Ataa.
 
 **TAKING WATER INTO THE NOSE WITH THE RIGHT HAND AND EXPELLING IT WITH
 THE LEFT**
 
 'Abd Khair said: We were sitting looking towards 'Alee - as he made
 wudoo - and he entered into his mouth a handful of water with his
 right hand and washed his mouth and nose, then expelled it from his
 nose with his left hand - he did that three times, then said: Whoever
 would like to see the way of purification of Rasoolullah (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) - then this is his purification. \[Reported by ad-
 Daarimee. Ash-shaikh al-Albaanee says in his notes on al-Mishkaat: Its
 isnaad is saheeh\].

WASHING THE FACE
================

 The face (wajh) is determined as being everything between the
 beginnings of the hair down to the cheeks and the chin, and up to the
 start of the ears including that which is between the beard and ear.
 
 Allah ta'ala says: O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash
 your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads
 (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles.
 \[soorat-ul-Maa'idah,5:7\]
 
 Humraan ibn Abaan narrates that 'Uthmaan (radhiAllahu 'anhu) called
 for water to make wudoo and so mentioned the way in which the Prophet
 (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo . Humraan said: Then he
 washed his face three times. \[Al- Bukhaaree (al-Fath, 1/312), Muslim
 (no.226)\].

RUNNING WATER THROUGH THE BEARD WITH THE FINGERS
================================================

1. 'Uthmaan (radhiAllahu'anhu) narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) used to run his (wet fingers) through his beard.
  \[At-Tirmidhee (no.31), Ibn Maajah (no.430), Ibn Jaarood (p.43) and
  al-Haakim (1/14\~) who declared its isnaad as saheeh as did Ibn
  Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibbaan. See the note in al-Baghagawi's Sharh
  us-Sunnah, 1/421\].

2. Anas (radhiAllahu'anhu) narrates that the Prophet
  (sallallaahu'alaihi wa sallam), when he made wudoo , used to take a
  handful of water and enter it below his chin and rub it through his
  beard and said **This is what my Lord - the Great and Exalted - has
  ordered me to do.** \[Abo Dawood (no.145), al-Baihaqee (1/54), al-
  Haakim (1/149). Ash-Shaikh al-Albaani declares it to be saheeh
  (Saheeh ul-Jaami', no.4572)\].

 Some of the scholars have declared that entering water through the
 beard is obligatory and say: If he deliberately leaves it - then he
 must repeat the ( wudoo and) prayer. And this is the saying of Imam
 Ishaaq and Abu Thaur.
 
 Most of the scholars however are of the opinion that the order is an
 order of desirability (istihbaab) and it is not obligatory - and that
 it is clearer that that which is obligatory is moving water through
 that part of the beard..so that it reaches the skin underneath.
 \[Al-Khattaabee, 1/56\].
 
 Imam Ahmad and Laith and most of the scholars hold that moving water
 through the beard is obligatory when taking ghusl from Janaabah - and
 not obligatory in wudoo . \['Aun al Ma'bood, 1/247\].

WASHING THE ARMS INCLUDING THE ELBOWS
=====================================

 Note: The arms here which we are ordered to wash begin with the
 fingertips and hands - which are to be included in this washing - they
 being part of the arm (yad) which we are ordered to Wash in the aayah.
 
 Allah ta'ala says: O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash
 your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads
 (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles.
 \[soorat-ul-Maa'idah,5:7\]
 
 Humraan ibn Abaan reports that 'Uthmaan (radhiAllahu'anhu) called for
 water for wudoo and mentioned the Prophet's (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
 sallam) way of making wudoo - and Humraan said: Then he washed his
 right arm including the elbow three times, then the left in the same
 way. \[Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim as has preceded\].
 
 Regarding inclusion of the elbows in the washing of the arms -
 scholars have differed: Some of them saying that they must be included
 in this washing, and others saying that this is not so. And this
 difference of opinion is due to their disagreement over the meaning of
 the word "ilaa" (to) in the aayah - does it mean 'up to/until' or 'up
 to and including' ?
 
 He who says that it means 'up to' does not include the elbows in the
 washing - just as Allah ta'ala says: ... thumma 'atimmus-siyaama ilaa
 -llail: Then complete your fast till the night appears;
 \[soorat-ul-Baqara, 2:187\]. And this is the opinion of some of the
 companions of Imam Maalik.
 
 Most scholars, however, hold the view that the meaning is 'up to and
 including/along with' - and thus include the elbows in the washing and
 use as their evidence Allah ta'ala's saying: ...wa yayazidkum
 quwwatan ilaa quwwatikum...: ...and add strength to your strength;
 \[Soorat-ul-Hud 11:52\]

1. The proof in this matter is the hadeeth of Nu'aim ibn Mijmar who
  said: I saw Abu Hurairah make wudoo - he washed his face and
  completed the wudoo , then washed his right hand until he reached
  the upper arm, then his left hand till he reached the upper arm" -
  then in the end of the hadeeth he said: "This is how I saw
  Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) make wudoo . \[Muslim,
  1/246\]

 So, dear reader, it is clear from this hadeeth that the Prophet
 (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) used to wash the elbows further, he
 used to increase upon that and wash part of the upper arm.

1. Jaabir (radhiAllahu'anhu) said that when the Prophet (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallarn) made wudoo , he would pass the water over his
  elbows. \[Reported by ad- Daaraqutnee (1/15), al-Baihaqee (1/56) and
  others - Ibn Hajr declared it to be hasan. And Ash-Shaikh
  al-Albaanee declared it to be saheeh (Saheeh ul-Jaami', 4547)\].

WIPING THE HEAD AND EARS AND 'IMAAMAH
=====================================

 1\. Wiping over all of the head as Allah ta'ala says: ...wamsahoo bi
 ru'oosikum...:
 
 ...rub your heads (with water) \[Soorat-ul-Maa'idah 5:7\]
 
 Ibn Qudaamah says in 'al-Mughnee': Some of the people who claim that
 that which is ordered to be wiped is part of the head only - claim
 that the (Baa) \[in the verse\] means "part of" as if He had said:
 "Wipe part of your heads".' However, we say that in His saying
 wamsahoo bi ru'oosikum the (Baa) is as if He said regarding Tayammum
 wamsahoo bi wujoohikum \[Allah ta'ala orders us to wipe the faces\].
 
 Therefore their saying that the (Baa) means "part of" is incorrect and
 unknown to the scholars of the language. Ibn Burhaan says: 'He who
 claims that the "baa"
 
 means "part of" has declared before the scholars of the language that
 of which they have no knowledge. \[al-Mughnee, 1/112\].
 
 Ash-Shaukaanee (rahimahullah) says in Nail-ul-Autaar: It is not
 established that it means "part of" and Seebawaih (one of the foremost
 scholars of the Arabic language) has denied that in fifteen places in
 his book. (Nail-ul-Autaar, 1/193).
 
 35\. In the hadeeth of'Abdullaah ibn Zaid (radhiAllahu'anhu) is a
 further proof of the incorrectness of the saying that it means "a part
 of" - in that the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) wiped his head
 with his two hands, moving them forwards and backwards - beginning with
 the front of the head and (wiping) with them up to his nape then he
 (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) returned them to the place from which he
 began. \[Al-Bukhaaree (al-Fath, 1/251), Muslim (no.235), at-Tirmidhee
 (no.28) and others\].
 
 2\. Wiping the ears: The ruling for the ears is the same as that for the
 head.

36. And it is authentically reported that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) said **The two ears are a part of the head.**
  \[Reported by at-Tirmidhee, no.37; Abu Dawood, no.l34 and Ibn
  Maajah, no.444\]. (Declared by ash-Shaikh al-Albaanee to be saheeh -
  as-Saheehah, 1/36 - and Imam Ahmad was of the view that wiping the
  ears has the same ruling as that for wiping the head.)\]

 As for those who hold the view that it is a sunnah they do not have
 any evidence except their regarding this hadeeth as being da'eef - it
 is however authentic due to a chain of narration which they did not
 come across and so the proof is with our saying

-  and Allah Knows best.

 And of the scholars who hold that they are part of the head are Ibn
 al-Musayyib, 'Ataa, al-Hasan, Ibn Seereen, Sa'eed ibn Jubair and
 an-Nakha'ee and it is the saying of ath-Thauree and Ahl ur-Ra'y and
 Imams Malik and Ahmad ibn Hanbal.

TAKING FRESH WATER FOR THE HEAD AND EARS
========================================

36. Ash-Shaikh al-Albaanee says in 'ad-Da'eefah', no.995: There is not
  to be found in the Sunnah anything which obligates taking fresh
  water for the ears - therefore he should wipe them along with the
  water for the head - just as it is also permissible to wipe the head
  with the water remaining from that of the arms after washing them
  according to the hadeeth of Ar-Rabee' bint Mu'awwidh that the
  Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) "wiped his head with water
  remaining in his hand". \[Reported by Abu Dawood and others with
  hasan isnaad\].

THE WAY OF WIPING
=================

36. From 'Abdullaah ibn 'Amr - about the way of performing wudoo - he
  said: Then he (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) wiped his head and
  entered his two forefingers into his ears and wiped the backs of his
  ears with his thumbs. \[Reported by Abu Dawood (no.135), an-Nasaa'ee
  (no.140), Ibn Maajah (no.422) and authenticated by Ibn Khuzairnah\].

WIPING OVER THE 'IMAAMAH (TURBAN) ONLY
======================================

36. 'Amr ibn Umayyah (radhiAllahu 'anhu) said: I saw Rasoolullah
  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) wipe over his turban and leather
  socks. \[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (al Fath, 1/266) and others\].

37. Bilaal (radhiAllahu 'anhu) reports that the Prophet
  (sallallaahu'alaihi wa sallam) wiped over the leather socks and the
  head cover. \[Reported by Muslim, 1/159\].

WIPING OVER THE TURBAN AND FORELOCK
===================================

36. Al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah (radhiAllahu'anhu) reports that the
  Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo and wiped over
  his forelock and over the turban and leather socks. \[Reported by
  Muslim, 1/159\].

 Ibn Qudaamah says in 'al-Mughnee' (1/310); And if part of the head is
 uncovered and it is normally so, then it is preferable to wipe over
 that along with the turban - that is recorded from Ahmad: as the
 Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) wiped over his turban and
 forelock - as occurs in the hadeeth of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah.
 
 As for caps/'prayer hats', it is not permissible to wipe over them as
 Ahmad says for various reasons, from them: (1) They do not cover all
 of the head normally, nor are they tied around it. (2) There is no
 difficulty in their removal.
 
 As for the woman's head cover - it is permissible to wipe over it as
 Umm Salamah used to wipe over her head cover - as reported by Ibn
 al-Mundhir. (See'al-Mughnee', 1/312).

WASHING THE FEET AND ANKLES
===========================

 Allah ta'ala says: ...wa arjulakum ilaal ka'bayn...: ...and (wash)
 your feet to the ankles \[Soorat-ul-Maa'idah 5:7\] \[thus ordering the
 washing of the feet and ankles\].

36. Ibn 'Umar (radhiAllahu 'anhumaa) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) fell behind us and then came upon us during a
  journey, then we found him and it was time for 'Asr - so we began to
  make wudoo and wipe over our feet, so he (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) called out at the top of his voice Woe to the ankles from
  the Fire. (two or three times) \[Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath, 1/232) and
  Muslim, 3/128\].

 An-Nawawi says in his explanation of Sahih Muslim after mentioning the
 hadeeth: Muslim's intention (rahimahullah) in quoting these hadeeth
 was to prove with it the obligation of washing the feet - and that
 wiping them is not sufficient.

36. In the hadeeth of al-Bukhaaree and Muslim from Humraan ibn Abaan
  that 'Uthmaan (radhiAllahu'anhu) called for water for wudoo and
  then mentioned the wudoo of the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) - then Humraan said: Then he washed his right foot to the
  ankle three times and then his left foot to the ankle three times.

37. As Abu Hurairah (radhiAllahu 'anhu) did in Muslim's narration:
  "Then he washed his right foot till he reached the shin, then he
  washed the left foot till he reached the

 shin" and in the end of the hadeeth said: This is what I saw
 Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) do. \[Muslim, 1/246\].
 
 From this hadeeth - O Brother Muslim - it becomes clear that the
 ankles enter into this washing as is clear from his saying 'till he
 reached the shin'.

36. Al-Mustaurad (radhiAllahu 'anhu) said: When the Prophet
  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo he would enter the water
  between his toes with his little finger. \[Reported by Abu Dawood
  (no.148), at-Tinnidhee (no.40) and Ibn Maajah (no.446). Declared as
  'saheeh' by al-Albaanee\].

 As-San'aanee says in 'Subul-us-Salaam' after quoting this hadeeth: It
 is a proof for the obligation of wiping between the toes - and this
 also occurs in the hadeeth of Ibn 'Abbaas which we have indicated -
 which is reported by at-Tirmidhee, Ahmad, Ibn Maajah and al-Haakim -
 and authenticated by al-Bukhaaree. And it is done by using the little
 finger. (See 'Subul-us-Salaam', 1/48).

36. And Laqeet ibn Sabarah said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  salam) said **Complete the wudoo and wipe between the Asaabi'**
  (fingers and/or toes). \[Abu Dawood (no.142), at-Tirmidhee (no.37),
  an-Nasaa'ee (no.114), Ibn Maajah (no.407), al-Hakim (1/148).
  Al-Albaanee says: Saheeh.\]. As-San'aanee says: It clearly means
  both the fingers and toes and is shown clearly in the hadeeth of Ibn
  'Abbaas. \[Subul-us-Salaam, 1/47\].

THE REPLY TO THOSE WHO FOLLOW WIPING OF THE FEET WITHOUT WASHING
================================================================

(1) Wiping the feet when not wearing anything on the foot is not
  established from the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam)**.** As
  for their using as a proof the reading of the Aayah: wamsahoo bi
  ru'oosikum wa arjulakum ilaal ka'bayn: rub your heads and your feet
  to the ankles...\[soorat-ul-Maaidah 5:7\] reading (arjulikum) - and
  saying that the feet are thus connected to (the command to wipe) the
  heads - and this is not correct, rather they are connected to (the
  order to wash) the hands. As for the reading of the word (arjulikum)
  with Kasra of the laam - as-San'aanee says That is for wiping over
  the leather socks - as is shown by the Sunnah - and this is the best
  interpretation for this particular recital. (As-Subul, 1/58).

(2) The Qur'aan is not to be explained according to the human
  intellect - especially in the matters of worship such as Salaat and
  wudoo , etc. - but by the Sunnah which explains this Pillar. And
  there are many such examples in the Qur'an which the Prophet
  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) explained by his sayings - and from
  this is the washing of the feet - and its proof from the Sunnah has
  preceded.

(3) If they wish to use the intellect then we say to them: The bottom of
  the foot has more right to be wiped than the surface (their saying
  being the wiping of the surface), and if they say: Then what about
  the socks? we say: That is established from the Prophet (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) just as washing the foot is also established in
  the Sunnah.

(4) Leaving out one of two verbs and sufficing with one of them, as the
  Arabs, when two verbs come together having similar meaning and are
  followed by things related

 to them, makes it permissible to mention only one of the two verbs and
 attaching those things relating to the second to those relating to the
 first which is mentioned - according to what the wording demands,
 until it is as if the two are partners with regard to the verb, as the
 poet said: I fed it with hay and cold water. And what is meant is: I
 fed it with hay and gave it cold water to drink.

(1) The saying of az-Zajjaj (a great scholar of the language): It is
  permissible that the wording (arjulikum) has the meaning of 'wash
  the feet' as the wording (ilal Ka'bain) conveys that meaning - as
  the mentioning of a limit suggests washing just as Allah ta'ala
  says ilaal maraafiq \[that is the limit of the elbows is for
  washing\] however, if wiping were intended then there would be no
  need for mention of a limit just as Allah ta'ala says wamsahoo bi
  ru'oosikum not mentioning any limit (for wiping the head) and
  further the term wiping can be used to mean washing. (Al- Mirqaat,
  1/400).

(2) And further, the great majority of scholars have agreed that it is
  obligatory to wash the feet and that is reported - and reaches the
  level of mutawaatir from the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam)
  as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr says; and further it is not established that
  any of the Sahaabah differed regarding that - except what is
  reported from 'Alee, Ibn 'Abbas and Anas (radhiAllahu 'anhum) - and
  it is established that they went back on that. (Al-Mirqaat. 1/400\~.

<!-- -- 

36. And Abu Hurairah (radhiAllahu 'anhu) reports that Rasoolullah
  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) came to the graveyard and said
  .**..they will come on the Day of Judgement with their blazes
  shining from the wudoo** (It has preceded, no.7). Meaning the
  Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) will know from the
  traces of the washing, as for those who do not wash then he will not
  know them on the Day of Judgement.

 Ibn Hajr says: And it is established that this shining of the faces,
 hands and feet are particular to the Muslim Ummah.
 
 **OTHER ASPECTS OF WUDOO THE SIWAAK**
 
 The SIWAAK is that which the mouth is brushed with. And it is also
 called the MISWAAK, the plural being: SOOK. And the siwaak comes from
 the Araak tree and it is a well-known tree. Abu Hanifah said: It is
 the best of the trees whose twigs are used for brushing the teeth...
 smelling of milk. Abu Ziyaad said: From it is taken there tooth-sticks
 - from its twigs and roots - and the best part for that is its roots,
 and it is broadly spreading..And Ibn Shameel: The Araak is a tall
 fine-shoot green tree with many leaves and branches, having weak wood
 and growing in hollows - miswaaks are taken from it, being one of the
 citrus trees. Its singular is Araak and its plural Araa-ik.
 (Lisaan-ul-'Arab, 268).
 
 It is mustahabb (desirable) to use the siwaak at many different times
 as is established from the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam)
 that he used to use the siwaak at every Prayer, and before reading the
 Qur'an, and before sleeping and
 
 when waking, and when the breath changes - whether fasting or not - or
 whether at the start of the day or in the afternoon, and it is a form
 of worship which is easy therefore observe it, O my Muslim Brother.

36. And also when making wudoo , as Abu Hurairah (radhiAllahu 'anhu)
  narrates that Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said I**f
  I did not fear to cause hardship to my Ummah I would have ordered
  them to use the siwaak with every wudoo.** \[Reported by
  at-Tirrnidhee (no.22) who said: Hasan Saheeh, and Maalik (no.123),
  Ahmad (4/116), Abu Dawood (no.37) and others. Al-Albaanee declared
  it to be saheeh (Takhree; ul Mishkaat, no.390)\].

37. And 'Aa'ishah (radhiAllahu' anhaa) narrates that Rasoolullah
  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said **The siwaak is a means of
  cleansing the mouth and pleasing the Lord.** \[Al-Bukhaaree reports
  it in mu'allaq form - connected by Ahmad, an- Nasaa'ee, Ibn
  Khuzaimah and Ibn Hibbaan\].

 **AD-DALK (RUBBING THE WATER OVER THE BODY PARTS):** This is part of
 the
 
 wudoo authentically reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
 sallam). Al- Mustawrid ibn Shadad said: I saw Rasoolullah (sailallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) when he made wudoo rubbing his toes with his litle
 finger. \[Saheeh as has preceded\].

36. Abdullah ibn Zaid (radhiAllahu 'anhu) narrates that the Prophet
  (sallallaahu'alaihiwasallam) made wudoo and said **Rub in this
  way.** \[See Nail-ul- Autaar, 4/39\].

37. He (radhiAllahu'anhu) also narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo with two thirds of a mudd **\[3\]**
  (of water) and rubbed over his forearms. \[Ibn Khuzaimah (no.118),
  and its isnaad is Saheeh - and al-Haakim (1/161) reports it by way
  of Yahyaa ibn Abi Zaa'idah\].

PERFORMING THE WUDOO IN THE ORDER MENTIONED IN THE AYAAH
========================================================

 As for what is narrated regarding the 'order' as mentioned in the
 Aayah, then there is nothing to contradict that - and this order is
 obligatory (waajib) and it is said: Sunnah. \[See Fiqh al Imam Sa'eed
 ibn al Musayyib, 1/64\].
 
 As for what is related with regard to the Prophet's wudoo (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) then it has been reported sometimes out of the
 regular order. And the proof is:

36. Al-Miqdaam ibn Ma'd Yakrib said: I came to the Prophet (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) with water for wudoo , so he washed his hands
  three times, then washed his face three times, then washed his
  forearms three times, then washed his mouth and nose three times,
  then wiped his head and ears - their outsides and insides - and
  washed each of his feet three times. \[Ahmad (4/132), Abu Dawood
  (1/19) with Saheeh isnaad. Ash-Shaukaanee (1/1\~5) said: Its isnaad
  is good, and it is reported

 by ad-Diyaa in 'al-Mukhtaarah'. And al-Albaanee records it in
 'as-Saheehah', no.261\]
 
 .
 
 So this is a proof that he (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) did not
 always stick to the regular order - and this is a proof that it is not
 obligatory - however, his sticking to it mostly shows that it is
 Sunnah. And Allah Knows best.
 
 As-Suyooti says as is reported from him in 'Aun al Ma'bood' ( 1/48):
 It is used as a proof - that is the aforementioned hadeeth - by him
 who says that sticking to the regular order in wudoo is not obligatory
 as he washed his mouth and nose after washing his arms.
 
 The author of 'Aun al Ma'bood' says: This narration is 'shaadh'
 **\[4\]** - and therefore not to be taken in contradiction to the
 established narrations which put the washing of the mouth and nose
 before the washing of the face.
 
 I say: The difference of opinion between the scholars here is with
 regard to those parts of wudoo which are Sunnah. As for the obligatory
 duties - then they are according to the order mentioned in the noble
 Aayah, and the best thing is to perform all of the actions in the way
 mentioned in the majority of the ahaadeeth - and Allah Knows best.

AL-MAWAALAAT (WASHING EACH PART DIRECTLY AFTER THE PREVIOUS ONE - LEAVING NO TIME GAP IN BETWEEN)
=================================================================================================

 Nothing other than this is established from the Prophet (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam). It is however established that Ibn 'Umar
 (radhiAllahu' anhu) urinated within the market, then made wudoo and
 so washed his face and hands and wiped his head, then he was called to
 pray over a Janazzah so he entered the mosque then wiped over his
 leather socks, then prayed over it. \[Reported by Maalik (no.72) and
 al-Baihaqee (1/84). And 'Ataa didn't see anything wrong with leaving
 such gaps whilst making wudoo and it is the saying of al-Hasan,
 an-Nakha'ee and the better reported of the two sayings of
 ash-Shaafi'ee\].

BEGINNING WITH THE RIGHT
========================

 That is washing the right hand before the left - and likewise the
 feet.

36. 'Aaishah (radhiAllahu 'annaa) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) used to like to begin with the right in putting
  on shoes, combing his hair, in purification and in all of his
  affairs. \[Al-Bukhaaree (al Fath) 1/235, Muslim (no.267) and
  others\].

37. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllahu'anhu) narrates that the Prophet
  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said **When you dress and when you
  make wudoo , then begin with the right.** \[Abu Dawood (4141),
  at-Tirmidhee (1766), an-Nasaa'ee (402). Al- Albaanee declares it to
  be saheeh\].

ECONOMIZING IN THE USE OF WATER AND NOT BEING WASTEFUL
======================================================

36. Anas (radhiAllahu 'anhu) said: The Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) used to make wudoo with a mudd (of water) and make ghusl
  with a saa' or up to five mudds. \[Muslim (1/156) and others\]. A
  saa' is equal to four mudds. ( A mudd is that amount of water which
  is held by the two hands cupped together.)

 If you consider this hadeeth well, O my Muslim Brother, you would feel
 ashamed of what some people do these days - one of them opening the
 water tap and making wudoo and sometimes talking to his companion
 whilst the water is running out - what an excess in wastefulness! So
 he who does that should fear Allah and remember this hadeeth and keep
 it in mind and follow the Sunnah with regard to using the water
 sparingly and not being wasteful - and here the true following of the
 Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) is made clear and the true
 Muslim's belief. It is from the Sunnah for the Muslim who wishes to
 make wudoo to have with him a container large enough for a mudd of
 water - in order to force himself to return to the following of the
 Sunnah.

THE DU'AA AFTER THE WUDOO
=========================

36. 'Umar ibn al-Khattaab (radhiAllahu 'anhu) said: Rasoolullah
  (sallallaahu 'alahi wa sallam) said **None of you makes wudoo and
  completes the wudoo then says:**

 **Ashhadu anlaa ilaaha illallaahu wahdahu laa shareekalahu washhadu
 anna Muhammadan 'abduhu wa rasooluhu** (I bear witness that none has
 the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His
 slave andMessenger) **except that all eight Gates of Paradise are
 opened for him - so that he enters by whichever he pleases.**
 \[Reported by Muslim (no.234), Abu Dawood (no 169), at-Tirmidhee
 (no.55), an-Nasaa'ee (no.148), Ibn Maajah (no.470)\].
 
 And at-Tirmidhee adds an authentic addition to it:
 
 **Allahumma aj'alnee minat-tawwabeen waj'alnee minal mutatahhireen**
 (O Allah, make me one of those who constantly repents toYou and of
 those who purify themselves.) \[Declared as Sahih by al-Albaanee\].

36. Abu Sa'eed al-Khudree (radhiAllahu 'anhu) said Rasoolullah
  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam)said **Whoever makes wudoo then says
  upon finishing the wudoo:**

 **Subhaanakallaahumma wa bihamdika ashhadu anlaa ilaaha illa anta
 astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilaika** (I declare You free from all defects
 my Lord and all praise belongs to you and I bear witness that there is
 none worthy of worship except You. I seek Your forgiveness and I turn
 to You) **It is written in a parchment, then sealed and is not opened
 till Judgement Day.** \[Reported by Ibn ar-Sunnee in 'Amal al Yaurn
 wal-l\~ilah, no.30. Declared as Saheeh by al-Albaanee\].

WASHING EACH BODY-PART ONCE
===========================

 68\. Ibn 'Abbaas (radhiAllahu 'anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) made wudoo (washing each part) once. \[Al-Bukhaaree
 (al Fath) 1/226\].

WASHING EACH BODY-PART TWICE
============================

59. 'Abdullaah ibn Zaid narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi
  wa sallam) made wudoo (washing each part) twice. \[Al-Bukhaaree (al
  Fath) 1/226\].

WASHING EACH BODY-PART THRICE
=============================

59. In the hadeeth of 'Uthmaan (radhiAllahu 'anhu) recorded by
  al-Bukhaaree and Muslim, he (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) washed
  each of the parts three times.

 So from these ahaadeeth it becomes clear to us that, as is well-known
 to the large majority of scholars, washing each body-part once is
 obligatory - and the second and third washings are Sunnah - and it is
 better to do likewise following the Sunnah of the Prophet (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) \['al-Majmoo' of an-Nawawi, 1/229\].

THE DESIRABILITY OF MAKING WUDOO FOR EACH PRAYER
================================================

 Al-Haafiz says in 'al Fath' (1/172) in the question 'Making wudoo
 without having broken it':

59. Anas (radhiAllahu 'anhu) says: The Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) used to make wudoo for every prayer. I said: What had you
  (the Sahaabah) used to do? He said: One wudoo was sufficient for us
  till such time as we broke it.

 This hadeeth is an evidence that what is meant generally is the
 obligatory Prayer.
 
 Al-Tahaawee says: It may be that that was obligatory upon him
 (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) particularly - then was abrogated on
 the Day of Fath by the hadeeth of Buraidah - meaning that which Muslim
 reports - that he (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) prayed all the
 Prayers on the Day of Fath with one wudoo and that 'Umar
 
 (radhiAllahu 'anhu) asked him about that so he (sallallaahu 'alaihi
 wa sallam) said **I did it deliberately.** Or it may be that he
 (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) used to do it out of desirability
 only, then feared that it might be thought to be obligatory and so
 left it to show the permissibility of that.
 
 I say: The result is that making wudoo for every Prayer is mustahabb
 and praying all of the Prayers with one wudoo is permissible - and
 Allah Knows best.

THE ONE WHO IS NOT SURE IF HE HAS BROKEN THE WUDOO OR NOT RELIES UPON THAT WHICH HE IS CERTAIN OF
=================================================================================================

 If he who knows that he has made wudoo then is not sure that he has
 broken it - then his wudoo remains. And he who knows that he has done
 that which breaks wudoo and doubts when he has made wudoo thereafter
 then he does not have wudoo . In each case he relies upon that which
 he is certain of before that which he has doubt about - and he throws
 the doubt away. And this is the saying of the great majority of
 scholars - and it is the saying of Abu Hanifah, ash-Shaafi'ee and
 Ahmad. \['Al-Mughnee', 1/193, and \~iqh ul Awaaa'ee, 1/56\].

59. And the proof for this is what is established from Abu Hurairah
  (radhiAllahu 'anhu) who said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) said **If one of you feels something in his stomach and he
  isn't sure did anything (wind) come out of it or not - then let him
  not leave the mosque until he hears a sound or finds a smell.**
  \[Muslim (Sharh an-Nawawi, 4/51), 'Aaridat-ul-Ahwadhee Sharh ut-
  Tirmidhee, 1/79\].

 So the hadeeth is a proof that things remain upon their original state
 until there is a certainty of a change in that, and doubt does not
 harm that - so he who is sure of having made wudoo and thinks that he
 may have broken it, then he remains upon wudoo .

A MAN AND WOMAN'S WASHING FROM A SINGLE VESSEL
==============================================

59. Ibn 'Abbaas (radhiAllahu 'anhumaa) narrates that one of the wives
  of the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) took a ghusl from
  Janaabah then saw Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) about
  to take a ghusl from the water remaining - so she informed him that
  she had made ghusl therefrom - so Rasoolulah said **Nothing makes
  the water impure.** \[Reported by Abu Dawood (no.67), and
  an-Nasaa'ee (no.326), and at-Tirmidhee who declared it to be hasan
  saheeh, and Ibn Maajah (no.370)\].

 Ibn 'Abd ul-Barr says: There is nothing in the Sharee'ah to prevent
 each of them washing with the water remaining from the other - either
 together or one after the other, and this is the saying of the
 scholars of the different lands and the great majority of scholars -
 and the ahaadeeth about it are Mutawaatir. (Al-Istidhkaar, 1/373).

MAKING WUDOO AFTER EATING CAMEL MEAT
====================================

59. Jaabir ibn Samurah (radhiAllahu 'anhu) narrates that a man asked
  Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam): Should I make wudoo
  because of the meat of sheep?

 He (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said **If you wish make wudoo and
 if you wish then do not make wudoo.** He said: Should I make wudoo
 from the meat of the camel? He (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said
 **Yes, make wudoo from the meat of the camel.** He asked: May I pray
 in sheep-pens? He (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said **Yes.** He
 asked: May I pray in the stalls of camels? He (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
 sallam) said **No.** \[Reported by Muslim, 1/189\].

DRYING THE BODY PARTS AFTER PURIFICATION
========================================

 'Uthman ibn 'Affaan, al- Hasan ibn 'Alee, Anas ibn Maalik, al-Hasan
 al-Basree, Ibn Seereen, 'Alqamah, al-Aswad, Masrooq, ad-Dahhaak,
 'Abdullaah ibn al Haarith, Abu Ya'laa, Abul Ahwas, Ash-Sha'bee,
 Ath-Thawree, Ishaaq, Ibn 'Umar in a narration, and Abu Hanifah,
 Maalik, Ahmad, and the Shafi'ee Madhhab in one saying, all say that it
 is permissible after both wudoo and ghusl to dry the body-parts. And
 their evidence is what 'Aa'ishah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) reports - she
 said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) had a cloth which he
 used to dry himself with after making wudoo . \[Reported by
 at-Tirmidhee who declared it to be da'eef\]. Then al Ainee states that
 an-Nasaa'ee records it in 'al-Kunaa' with saheeh isnaad.
 
 I say: And it has other narrations which support and strengthen it.
 (See Fiqh al- Imam Sa'eed, 1/70). Al-Albaanee declares the hadeeth to
 be hasan. (Saheeh ul Jaami', 4706).

59. Salmaan al-Faarsee narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) made wudoo , then turned up a woollen cloak he had and wiped
  his face with it. \[Reported by Ibn Maajah (no.468)\]. In
  az-Zawaa'id it is said: Its isnaad is saheeh.

 I say: In its isnaad is al-Wadeen ibn 'Ataa who is sadooq but has a
 bad memory as al-Haafiz Ibn Hajr says in 'Taqreeb ut-Tahdheeb', so its
 isnaad is da'eef!! - but it is strengthened by the previous hadeeth of
 'Aa'ishah to the level of hasan - and Allah Knows best.
 
 Some others hold it to be makrooh to dry the body-parts after
 Purification and their proof is:

59. What is established from Maimoonah (radhiAllahu'anhaa) who
  described the Prophet's (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) ghusl from
  Janaabah and said: Then I brought him a cloth but he refused it.
  \[Al-Bukhaaree, and Muslim - and the word is his\].

 The Final word: Is that drying the body-parts is one of the desirable
 actions as shown by the hadeeth of Aa'ishah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) - as
 for the saying that it is makrooh then that is not acceptable as the
 saying of Maimoonah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) "but he refused it" does not
 amount to the fact that it is makrooh - and Allah Knows best.

THOSE THINGS WHICH BREAK WUDOO
==============================

THAT WHICH COMES OUT FROM THE TWO PRIVATE PARTS (FRONT AND BACK):
=================================================================

 Abu Hurairah (radhiAllahu 'anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) said **Allah does not accept the prayer of any one
 of you having committed hadath until he makes wudoo.** \[Al-Bukhaaree
 (al Fath, 1/206) and Muslim (no.245)\].

59. An-Nawawi says in 'al-Majmoo' (2/3) as for that which comes out of
  the two private parts - then it breaks wudoo according to Allah
  ta'alas saying: Aw jaa'a ahadukum min al ghaa'it...: or one of you
  comes from offices of nature...\[Soorat-ul-Maa'idah 5:7\] along with
  his (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) saying **There is no wudoo
  except from a sound or a smell.** \[Saheeh and has preceded (Saheeh
  ul Jaarni' (7443)\].

 He adds: So that which comes out of the front or back part of a man or
 woman breaks the wudoo - whether excretion or urine or wind - or a
 worm or pus or blood or stones or anything else and there is no
 difference in that for something which happens normally or rarely.

(1) **SOUND SLEEP \[5\]**

<!-- -- 

59. 'Alee ibn Abi Taalib (radhiAllahu 'anhu) said: Rasoolullah
  (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said **The eye is the drawstring for
  the anus, so he who sleeps then let him make wudoo.** \[Abu Dawood
  (no.203), Ibn Maajah (no.477), Ahmad. Declared as Saheeh by
  al-Albaanee\].

 In the hadeeth is an evidence that sleep does not in itself something
 that breaks wudoo , however the Purification is broken if it is
 possible for something to come out from the anus - however if that is
 restricted, e.g. by sitting flat on the earth, then that is not the
 case.

(1) **BECOMING UNCONSCIOUS - OTHER THAN SLEEP**

 That is the 'intellect' going away by any means because of insanirt or
 fainting or intoxication - as in this condition he does not know
 whether his wudoo is broken or not. This is the saying of the great
 majority of scholars. (Sharh Saheeh Muslim (4/74) and al-Mughnee
 (1/164)).

(1) Touching the Uncovered Private Parts 69. Abu Hurairah (radhiAllahu
  'anhu) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) said **If
  one of you touches his penis and there is no veil between him and it
  nor any cover, then wudoo has become obligatory for him.**
  \[al-Haakim (1/138) and others\]. (Al-Albaanee says: hadeeth
  Saheeh.)

(2) **TOUCHING THE PENIS**

<!-- -- 

70. Busrah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) said: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu 'alaihi
  wa sallam) said **If one of you touches his penis then let him make
  wudoo.** \[At-Tirmidhee (1/18) who said it is hasan saheeh. And also
  declared as Saheeh by Ahmad, al- Bukhaaree and Ibn Ma'een (Lum'aat
  ut-Tanqeeh Sharh Mishkaat ul Masaabeeh, no.319). Others also narrate
  it as authentic\].

71. Talq ibn 'Alee (radhiAllahu'anhu) said: Rasoolullah
  (sallallaahu'alaihi wa sallam) was asked about a man's touching his
  penis. Should he make wudoo ? He (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam)
  said **And is it except a part of him?** \[At-Tirmidhee (no.85) and
  he said: And this is the best of what is reported in this regard\].
  Al- Albaanee says: Its isnaad is Saheeh, and this (the view that it
  doesn't break the wudoo) is established as being that of a group of
  the Sahaabah, from them: Ibn Mas'ood, 'Ammaar ibn Yaasir, and
  because of these Imam Ahmad gave the choice between this and the one
  before it. Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah harmonized the two
  carrying the first to mean if he touched it with desire and this
  upon the touching without desire - and there is in this hadeeth that
  which gives that impression and it is his (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) saying 'a part of him'. \[Al-Mishkaat al Masaabeeh, notes on
  nos.3 19 and 320\].

(1) **TOUCHING A WOMAN WITH DESIRE**

<!-- -- 

70. A man's touching a woman without desire does not break the wudoo .
  'Aa'ishah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) says: Rasoolullah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) prayed and I was lying in front of him as in
  front of a Janaazah, so when he wished to prostrate I pulled up my
  leg. \[Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim\].

71. And in the same way a woman's touching a man without desire does not
  break wudoo as is established from 'Aa'ishah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa):
  I didn't find the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) one night
  so I tried to find him with my hand - and my hand fell upon his feet
  which were raised up as he was making prostration. \[Muslim (3/203)
  and an-Nasaa'ee (l/101)\].

 So we see from these two hadeeth that merely touching does not break
 the wudoo - and Allah Knows best.
 
 The author of'at-Ta'leeqaat us-Salafiyyah' upon Sunan of an-Nasaa'ee
 (1/23) says concerning "he pushed me with his foot": It is well-known
 that that is a touching without desire. And so the author uses it as a
 proof that touching without desire does not break the wudoo . As for
 the touching with desire - its proof is that the wudoo is not broken
 until a proof is established that it does indeed break it - and this
 is enough of a proof to show that it doesn't break the wudoo for the
 one who holds that view - and above and beyond that is a further proof
 that it doesn't break the wudoo is the hadeeth of kissing - as
 normally kissing is not free from touching with desire.
 
 The author of 'Aun al Ma'bood' (1/69) says regarding her saying "he
 kissed me and did not make wudoo"' - It contains a proof that touching
 a woman does not break the wudoo as kissing is part of touching and
 the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam) did not make wudoo (before
 praying). And this (that touching a woman even with desire doesn't
 break the wudoo ) is the saying of 'Alee and Ibn 'Abbaas and 'Ataa ibn
 Taawoos, and Abu Hanifah and Sufyaan ath-Thawree. And this hadeeth is
 (in itself) da'eef but is supported by other narrations. And it is
 mursal - however ad- Daaraqutnee joins it - and it is (therefore) an
 authentic (saheeh) hadeeth inshaaAllah. (See Nasb ur Raayah, l/70).
 
 The author of 'al-Mughnee' (1/190) says: The touching is not in itself
 something which breaks wudoo but breaks wudoo as it leads to
 prostratic fluid or semen being emitted - so the condition which leads
 to breaking of the wudoo is considered - and that is when there is
 desire.
 
 Summary: That when a man and woman are safe from anything being
 emitted which breaks wudoo - then their wudoo is not broken; and it is
 preferable to be on the safe side, as they may not be safe from such
 emissions in the condition of desire - and Allah Knows best.
 
 **CONCLUSION**
 
 This is what Allah ta'ala has made easy for us to gather together
 about the wudoo and its rulings, so we hope from Allah the Most High,
 the All-Powerful, that we have been able to do justice to the subject
 - and we hope that any scholarly solicitous brother who comes across
 anything in our booklet which is incorrect to cover up and give
 sincere advice. And it is Allah who grants success.
