 
TAKING WATER INTO THE NOSE WITH THE RIGHT HAND AND EXPELLING IT WITH THE LEFT
=================================

ʿAbd Khair said: We were sitting looking towards 'Alee - as he made _wuḍū_ - and he entered into his mouth a handful of water with his right hand and washed his mouth and nose, then expelled it from his
 nose with his left hand - he did that three times, then said: Whoever
 would like to see the way of purification of the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) - then this is his purification. \[Reported by ad-
 Daarimee. Shaykh al-Albānī says in his notes on al-Mishkaat: Its
 _isnād_ is _ṣaḥīḥ_\].

WASHING THE FACE
================

 The face (wajh) is determined as being everything between the
 beginnings of the hair down to the cheeks and the chin, and up to the
 start of the ears including that which is between the beard and ear.
 
 Allah ta'ala says: O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash
 your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads
 (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles.
 \[soorat-ul-Maa'idah,5:7\]
 
 Humrān ibn Abān narrates that ʿUthmān \mabpwhim called
 for water to make _wuḍū_ and so mentioned the way in which the Prophet
 \pbuh made _wuḍū_. Humraan said: Then he
 washed his face three times. \[Al- Bukhaaree (al-Fatḥ, 1/312), Muslim
 (#226)\].

RUNNING WATER THROUGH THE BEARD WITH THE FINGERS
================================================

1. ʿUthmān \mabpwhim narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) used to run his (wet fingers) through his beard.
  \[al-Tirmidhī (#31), Ibn Mājah (#430), Ibn Jaarood (p.43) and
  al-Haakim (1/14\~) who declared its _isnād_ as _ṣaḥīḥ_ as did Ibn
  Khuzaymah and Ibn Ḥibbān. See the note in al-Baghagawi's Sharh
  us-Sunnah, 1/421\].

2. Anas \mabpwhim narrates that the Prophet
  (sallallaahu'alaihi wa sallam), when he made _wuḍū_ , used to take a
  handful of water and enter it below his chin and rub it through his
  beard and said **This is what my Lord - the Great and Exalted - has
  ordered me to do.** \[Abu Dāwūd (#145), al-Baihaqee (1/54), al-
  Haakim (1/149). Shaykh al-Albaani declares it to be _ṣaḥīḥ_
  (_ṣaḥīḥ_ ul-Jaami', #4572)\].

 Some of the scholars have declared that entering water through the
 beard is obligatory and say: If he deliberately leaves it - then he
 must repeat the ( _wuḍū_ and) prayer. And this is the saying of Imam
 Ishaaq and Abū Thaur.
 
 Most of the scholars however are of the opinion that the order is an
 order of desirability (istihbaab) and it is not obligatory - and that
 it is clearer that that which is obligatory is moving water through
 that part of the beard..so that it reaches the skin underneath.
 \[Al-Khattaabee, 1/56\].
 
 Imam Aḥmad and Laith and most of the scholars hold that moving water
 through the beard is obligatory when taking ghusl from Janaabah - and
 not obligatory in _wuḍū_ . \['Aun al Ma'bood, 1/247\].

WASHING THE ARMS INCLUDING THE ELBOWS
=====================================

 Note: The arms here which we are ordered to wash begin with the
 fingertips and hands - which are to be included in this washing - they
 being part of the arm (yad) which we are ordered to Wash in the aayah.
 
 Allah ta'ala says: O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash
 your faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads
 (with water); and (wash) your feet to the ankles.
 \[soorat-ul-Maa'idah,5:7\]
 
 Humrān ibn Abān reports that ʿUthmān \mabpwhim called for
 water for _wuḍū_ and mentioned the Prophet's (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
 sallam) way of making _wuḍū_ - and Humraan said: Then he washed his
 right arm including the elbow three times, then the left in the same
 way. \[al-Bukhārī and Muslim as has preceded\].
 
 Regarding inclusion of the elbows in the washing of the arms -
 scholars have differed: Some of them saying that they must be included
 in this washing, and others saying that this is not so. And this
 difference of opinion is due to their disagreement over the meaning of
 the word "ilaa" (to) in the aayah - does it mean 'up to/until' or 'up
 to and including' ?
 
 He who says that it means 'up to' does not include the elbows in the
 washing - just as Allah ta'ala says: ... thumma 'atimmus-siyaama ilaa
 -llail: Then complete your fast till the night appears;
 \[soorat-ul-Baqara, 2:187\]. And this is the opinion of some of the
 companions of Imam Maalik.
 
 Most scholars, however, hold the view that the meaning is 'up to and
 including/along with' - and thus include the elbows in the washing and
 use as their evidence Allah ta'ala's saying: ...wa yayazidkum
 quwwatan ilaa quwwatikum...: ...and add strength to your strength;
 \[Soorat-ul-Hud 11:52\]

1. The proof in this matter is the _ḥadīth_ of Nu'aim ibn Mijmar who
  said: I saw Abū Hurayrah make _wuḍū_ - he washed his face and
  completed the _wuḍū_ , then washed his right hand until he reached
  the upper arm, then his left hand till he reached the upper arm" -
  then in the end of the _ḥadīth_ he said: "This is how I saw
  the Emissary of Allah \pbuh make _wuḍū_ . \[Muslim,
  1/246\]

 So, dear reader, it is clear from this _ḥadīth_ that the Prophet
 \pbuh used to wash the elbows further, he
 used to increase upon that and wash part of the upper arm.

1. Jaabir \mabpwhim said that when the Prophet (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallarn) made _wuḍū_ , he would pass the water over his
  elbows. \[Reported by ad- Daaraqutnee (1/15), al-Baihaqee (1/56) and
  others - Ibn Ḥajr declared it to be hasan. And Shaykh
  al-Albānī declared it to be _ṣaḥīḥ_ (_ṣaḥīḥ_ ul-Jaami', 4547)\].

WIPING THE HEAD AND EARS AND 'IMAAMAH
=====================================

 1\. Wiping over all of the head as Allah ta'ala says: ...wamsahoo bi
 ru'oosikum...:
 
 ...rub your heads (with water) \[Soorat-ul-Maa'idah 5:7\]
 
 Ibn Qudāmah says in _al-Mughnī_: Some of the people who claim that
 that which is ordered to be wiped is part of the head only - claim
 that the (Baa) \[in the verse\] means "part of" as if He had said:
 "Wipe part of your heads".' However, we say that in His saying
 wamsahoo bi ru'oosikum the (Baa) is as if He said regarding Tayammum
 wamsahoo bi wujoohikum \[Allah ta'ala orders us to wipe the faces\].
 
 Therefore their saying that the (Baa) means "part of" is incorrect and
 unknown to the scholars of the language. Ibn Burhaan says: 'He who
 claims that the "baa"
 
 means "part of" has declared before the scholars of the language that
 of which they have no knowledge. \[al-Mughnee, 1/112\].
 
 Ash-Shaukaanee (rahimahullah) says in Nail-ul-Autaar: It is not
 established that it means "part of" and Seebawaih (one of the foremost
 scholars of the Arabic language) has denied that in fifteen places in
 his book. (Nail-ul-Autaar, 1/193).
 
 35\. In the _ḥadīth_ ofʿAbd Allāh ibn Zayd \mabpwhim is a
 further proof of the incorrectness of the saying that it means "a part
 of" - in that the Prophet \pbuh wiped his head
 with his two hands, moving them forwards and backwards - beginning with
 the front of the head and (wiping) with them up to his nape then he
 \pbuh returned them to the place from which he
 began. \[al-Bukhārī (al-Fatḥ, 1/251), Muslim (#235), al-Tirmidhī
 (#28) and others\].
 
 2\. Wiping the ears: The ruling for the ears is the same as that for the
 head.

36. And it is authentically reported that the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) said **The two ears are a part of the head.**
  \[Reported by al-Tirmidhī, #37; Abū Dāwūd, #l34 and Ibn
  Maajah, #444\]. (Declared by Shaykh al-Albānī to be _ṣaḥīḥ_ -
  as-_ṣaḥīḥ_ah, 1/36 - and Imam Aḥmad was of the view that wiping the
  ears has the same ruling as that for wiping the head.)\]

 As for those who hold the view that it is a sunnah they do not have
 any evidence except their regarding this _ḥadīth_ as being da'eef - it
 is however authentic due to a chain of narration which they did not
 come across and so the proof is with our saying

-  and Allah Knows best.

 And of the scholars who hold that they are part of the head are Ibn
 al-Musayyib, 'Ataa, al-Hasan, Ibn Seereen, Sa'eed ibn Jubair and
 an-Nakha'ee and it is the saying of ath-Thauree and Ahl ur-Ra'y and
 Imams Malik and Aḥmad ibn Hanbal.

TAKING FRESH WATER FOR THE HEAD AND EARS
========================================

36. Shaykh al-Albānī says in 'ad-Da'eefah', #995: There is not
  to be found in the Sunnah anything which obligates taking fresh
  water for the ears - therefore he should wipe them along with the
  water for the head - just as it is also permissible to wipe the head
  with the water remaining from that of the arms after washing them
  according to the _ḥadīth_ of Ar-Rabee' bint Mu'awwidh that the
  Prophet \pbuh "wiped his head with water
  remaining in his hand". \[Reported by Abū Dāwūd and others with
  hasan _isnād_\].

THE WAY OF WIPING
=================

36. From ʿAbd Allāh ibn 'Amr - about the way of performing _wuḍū_ - he
  said: Then he \pbuh wiped his head and
  entered his two forefingers into his ears and wiped the backs of his
  ears with his thumbs. \[Reported by Abū Dāwūd (#135), al-Nasāʾī
  (#140), Ibn Mājah (#422) and authenticated by Ibn Khuzairnah\].

WIPING OVER THE 'IMAAMAH (TURBAN) ONLY
======================================

36. 'Amr ibn Umayyah \mabpwhim said: I saw the Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh wipe over his turban and leather
  socks. \[Reported by al-Bukhārī (al Fatḥ, 1/266) and others\].

37. Bilaal \mabpwhim reports that the Prophet
  (sallallaahu'alaihi wa sallam) wiped over the leather socks and the
  head cover. \[Reported by Muslim, 1/159\].

WIPING OVER THE TURBAN AND FORELOCK
===================================

36. Al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah \mabpwhim reports that the
  Prophet \pbuh made _wuḍū_ and wiped over
  his forelock and over the turban and leather socks. \[Reported by
  Muslim, 1/159\].

 Ibn Qudāmah says in _al-Mughnī_ (1/310); And if part of the head is
 uncovered and it is normally so, then it is preferable to wipe over
 that along with the turban - that is recorded from Aḥmad: as the
 Prophet \pbuh wiped over his turban and
 forelock - as occurs in the _ḥadīth_ of al-Mugheerah ibn Shu'bah.
 
 As for caps/'prayer hats', it is not permissible to wipe over them as
 Aḥmad says for various reasons, from them: (1) They do not cover all
 of the head normally, nor are they tied around it. (2) There is no
 difficulty in their removal.
 
 As for the woman's head cover - it is permissible to wipe over it as
 Umm Salamah used to wipe over her head cover - as reported by Ibn
 al-Mundhir. (See_al-Mughnī_, 1/312).

WASHING THE FEET AND ANKLES
===========================

 Allah ta'ala says: ...wa arjulakum ilaal ka'bayn...: ...and (wash)
 your feet to the ankles \[Soorat-ul-Maa'idah 5:7\] \[thus ordering the
 washing of the feet and ankles\].

36. Ibn 'Umar (radhiAllahu 'anhumaa) said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) fell behind us and then came upon us during a
  journey, then we found him and it was time for 'Asr - so we began to
  make _wuḍū_ and wipe over our feet, so he (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) called out at the top of his voice Woe to the ankles from
  the Fire. (two or three times) \[al-Bukhārī (al Fatḥ, 1/232) and
  Muslim, 3/128\].

 al-Nawawī says in his explanation of Sahih Muslim after mentioning the
 _ḥadīth_: Muslim's intention (rahimahullah) in quoting these _ḥadīth_
 was to prove with it the obligation of washing the feet - and that
 wiping them is not sufficient.

36. In the _ḥadīth_ of al-Bukhārī and Muslim from Humrān ibn Abān
  that ʿUthmān \mabpwhim called for water for _wuḍū_ and
  then mentioned the _wuḍū_ of the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) - then Humraan said: Then he washed his right foot to the
  ankle three times and then his left foot to the ankle three times.

37. As Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim did in Muslim's narration:
  "Then he washed his right foot till he reached the shin, then he
  washed the left foot till he reached the

 shin" and in the end of the _ḥadīth_ said: This is what I saw
 the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) do. \[Muslim, 1/246\].
 
 From this _ḥadīth_ - O Brother Muslim - it becomes clear that the
 ankles enter into this washing as is clear from his saying 'till he
 reached the shin'.

36. Al-Mustaurad \mabpwhim said: When the Prophet
  \pbuh made _wuḍū_ he would enter the water
  between his toes with his little finger. \[Reported by Abū Dāwūd
  (#148), at-Tinnidhee (#40) and Ibn Mājah (#446). Declared as
  '_ṣaḥīḥ_' by al-Albānī\].

 As-San'aanee says in 'Subul-us-Salaam' after quoting this _ḥadīth_: It
 is a proof for the obligation of wiping between the toes - and this
 also occurs in the _ḥadīth_ of Ibn 'Abbaas which we have indicated -
 which is reported by al-Tirmidhī, Aḥmad, Ibn Mājah and al-Haakim -
 and authenticated by al-Bukhārī. And it is done by using the little
 finger. (See 'Subul-us-Salaam', 1/48).

36. And Laqeet ibn Sabarah said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  salam) said **Complete the _wuḍū_ and wipe between the Asaabi'**
  (fingers and/or toes). \[Abū Dāwūd (#142), al-Tirmidhī (#37),
  al-Nasāʾī (#114), Ibn Mājah (#407), al-Hakim (1/148).
  al-Albānī says: _ṣaḥīḥ_.\]. As-San'aanee says: It clearly means
  both the fingers and toes and is shown clearly in the _ḥadīth_ of Ibn
  'Abbaas. \[Subul-us-Salaam, 1/47\].

THE REPLY TO THOSE WHO FOLLOW WIPING OF THE FEET WITHOUT WASHING
================================================================

(1) Wiping the feet when not wearing anything on the foot is not
  established from the Prophet \pbuh**.** As
  for their using as a proof the reading of the Aayah: wamsahoo bi
  ru'oosikum wa arjulakum ilaal ka'bayn: rub your heads and your feet
  to the ankles...\[soorat-ul-Maaidah 5:7\] reading (arjulikum) - and
  saying that the feet are thus connected to (the command to wipe) the
  heads - and this is not correct, rather they are connected to (the
  order to wash) the hands. As for the reading of the word (arjulikum)
  with Kasra of the laam - as-San'aanee says That is for wiping over
  the leather socks - as is shown by the Sunnah - and this is the best
  interpretation for this particular recital. (As-Subul, 1/58).

(2) The Qur'aan is not to be explained according to the human
  intellect - especially in the matters of worship such as Salaat and
  _wuḍū_ , etc. - but by the Sunnah which explains this Pillar. And
  there are many such examples in the Qur'an which the Prophet
  \pbuh explained by his sayings - and from
  this is the washing of the feet - and its proof from the Sunnah has
  preceded.

(3) If they wish to use the intellect then we say to them: The bottom of
  the foot has more right to be wiped than the surface (their saying
  being the wiping of the surface), and if they say: Then what about
  the socks? we say: That is established from the Prophet (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) just as washing the foot is also established in
  the Sunnah.

(4) Leaving out one of two verbs and sufficing with one of them, as the
  Arabs, when two verbs come together having similar meaning and are
  followed by things related

 to them, makes it permissible to mention only one of the two verbs and
 attaching those things relating to the second to those relating to the
 first which is mentioned - according to what the wording demands,
 until it is as if the two are partners with regard to the verb, as the
 poet said: I fed it with hay and cold water. And what is meant is: I
 fed it with hay and gave it cold water to drink.

(1) The saying of az-Zajjaj (a great scholar of the language): It is
  permissible that the wording (arjulikum) has the meaning of 'wash
  the feet' as the wording (ilal Ka'bain) conveys that meaning - as
  the mentioning of a limit suggests washing just as Allah ta'ala
  says ilaal maraafiq \[that is the limit of the elbows is for
  washing\] however, if wiping were intended then there would be no
  need for mention of a limit just as Allah ta'ala says wamsahoo bi
  ru'oosikum not mentioning any limit (for wiping the head) and
  further the term wiping can be used to mean washing. (Al- Mirqaat,
  1/400).

(2) And further, the great majority of scholars have agreed that it is
  obligatory to wash the feet and that is reported - and reaches the
  level of mutawaatir from the Prophet \pbuh
  as al-Haafiz Ibn Ḥajr says; and further it is not established that
  any of the Sahaabah differed regarding that - except what is
  reported from 'Alee, Ibn 'Abbas and Anas (radhiAllahu 'anhum) - and
  it is established that they went back on that. (Al-Mirqaat. 1/400\~.

<!-- -- 

36. And Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim reports that the Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh came to the graveyard and said
  .**..they will come on the Day of Judgement with their blazes
  shining from the _wuḍū_** (It has preceded, #7). Meaning the
  the Emissary of Allah \pbuh will know from the
  traces of the washing, as for those who do not wash then he will not
  know them on the Day of Judgement.

 Ibn Ḥajr says: And it is established that this shining of the faces,
 hands and feet are particular to the Muslim Ummah.
 
 **OTHER ASPECTS OF _wuḍū_ THE SIWAAK**
 
 The SIWAAK is that which the mouth is brushed with. And it is also
 called the MISWAAK, the plural being: SOOK. And the siwaak comes from
 the Araak tree and it is a well-known tree. Abū Hanifah said: It is
 the best of the trees whose twigs are used for brushing the teeth...
 smelling of milk. Abū Ziyaad said: From it is taken there tooth-sticks
 - from its twigs and roots - and the best part for that is its roots,
 and it is broadly spreading..And Ibn Shameel: The Araak is a tall
 fine-shoot green tree with many leaves and branches, having weak wood
 and growing in hollows - miswaaks are taken from it, being one of the
 citrus trees. Its singular is Araak and its plural Araa-ik.
 (Lisaan-ul-'Arab, 268).
 
 It is mustahabb (desirable) to use the siwaak at many different times
 as is established from the Prophet \pbuh
 that he used to use the siwaak at every Prayer, and before reading the
 Qur'an, and before sleeping and
 
 when waking, and when the breath changes - whether fasting or not - or
 whether at the start of the day or in the afternoon, and it is a form
 of worship which is easy therefore observe it, O my Muslim Brother.

36. And also when making _wuḍū_ , as Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim
  narrates that the Emissary of Allah \pbuh said I**f
  I did not fear to cause hardship to my Ummah I would have ordered
  them to use the siwaak with every _wuḍū_.** \[Reported by
  at-Tirrnidhee (#22) who said: Hasan _ṣaḥīḥ_, and Maalik (#123),
  Aḥmad (4/116), Abū Dāwūd (#37) and others. al-Albānī declared
  it to be _ṣaḥīḥ_ (Takhree; ul Mishkaat, #390)\].

37. And ʿĀʾishah (radhiAllahu' anhaa) narrates that the Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh said **The siwaak is a means of
  cleansing the mouth and pleasing the Lord.** \[al-Bukhārī reports
  it in mu'allaq form - connected by Aḥmad, an- Nasaa'ee, Ibn
  Khuzaymah and Ibn Ḥibbān\].

 **AD-DALK (RUBBING THE WATER OVER THE BODY PARTS):** This is part of
 the
 
 _wuḍū_ authentically reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
 sallam). Al- Mustawrid ibn Shadad said: I saw the Emissary of Allah (sailallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) when he made _wuḍū_ rubbing his toes with his litle
 finger. \[_ṣaḥīḥ_ as has preceded\].

36. Abdullah ibn Zayd \mabpwhim narrates that the Prophet
  (sallallaahu'alaihiwasallam) made _wuḍū_ and said **Rub in this
  way.** \[See Nail-ul- Autaar, 4/39\].

37. He \mabpwhim also narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) made _wuḍū_ with two thirds of a mudd **\[3\]**
  (of water) and rubbed over his forearms. \[Ibn Khuzaymah (#118),
  and its _isnād_ is _ṣaḥīḥ_ - and al-Haakim (1/161) reports it by way
  of Yahyaa ibn Abi Zaa'idah\].

PERFORMING THE _wuḍū_ IN THE ORDER MENTIONED IN THE AYAAH
========================================================

 As for what is narrated regarding the 'order' as mentioned in the
 Aayah, then there is nothing to contradict that - and this order is
 obligatory (_wājib_) and it is said: Sunnah. \[See Fiqh al Imam Sa'eed
 ibn al Musayyib, 1/64\].
 
 As for what is related with regard to the Prophet's _wuḍū_ (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) then it has been reported sometimes out of the
 regular order. And the proof is:

36. Al-Miqdaam ibn Ma'd Yakrib said: I came to the Prophet (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) with water for _wuḍū_ , so he washed his hands
  three times, then washed his face three times, then washed his
  forearms three times, then washed his mouth and nose three times,
  then wiped his head and ears - their outsides and insides - and
  washed each of his feet three times. \[Aḥmad (4/132), Abū Dāwūd
  (1/19) with _ṣaḥīḥ_ _isnād_. Ash-Shaukaanee (1/1\~5) said: Its _isnād_
  is good, and it is reported

 by ad-Diyaa in 'al-Mukhtaarah'. And al-Albānī records it in
 'as-_ṣaḥīḥ_ah', #261\]
 
 .
 
 So this is a proof that he \pbuh did not
 always stick to the regular order - and this is a proof that it is not
 obligatory - however, his sticking to it mostly shows that it is
 Sunnah. And Allah Knows best.
 
 As-Suyooti says as is reported from him in 'Aun al Ma'bood' ( 1/48):
 It is used as a proof - that is the aforementioned _ḥadīth_ - by him
 who says that sticking to the regular order in _wuḍū_ is not obligatory
 as he washed his mouth and nose after washing his arms.
 
 The author of 'Aun al Ma'bood' says: This narration is 'shaadh'
 **\[4\]** - and therefore not to be taken in contradiction to the
 established narrations which put the washing of the mouth and nose
 before the washing of the face.
 
 I say: The difference of opinion between the scholars here is with
 regard to those parts of _wuḍū_ which are Sunnah. As for the obligatory
 duties - then they are according to the order mentioned in the noble
 Aayah, and the best thing is to perform all of the actions in the way
 mentioned in the majority of the ahaadeeth - and Allah Knows best.

AL-MAWAALAAT (WASHING EACH PART DIRECTLY AFTER THE PREVIOUS ONE - LEAVING NO TIME GAP IN BETWEEN)
=================================================================================================

 Nothing other than this is established from the Prophet (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam). It is however established that Ibn 'Umar
 (radhiAllahu' anhu) urinated within the market, then made _wuḍū_ and
 so washed his face and hands and wiped his head, then he was called to
 pray over a Janazzah so he entered the mosque then wiped over his
 leather socks, then prayed over it. \[Reported by Maalik (#72) and
 al-Baihaqee (1/84). And 'Ataa didn't see anything wrong with leaving
 such gaps whilst making _wuḍū_ and it is the saying of al-Hasan,
 an-Nakha'ee and the better reported of the two sayings of
 ash-Shaafi'ee\].

BEGINNING WITH THE RIGHT
========================

 That is washing the right hand before the left - and likewise the
 feet.

36. 'Aaishah (radhiAllahu 'annaa) said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) used to like to begin with the right in putting
  on shoes, combing his hair, in purification and in all of his
  affairs. \[al-Bukhārī (al Fatḥ) 1/235, Muslim (#267) and
  others\].

37. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim narrates that the Prophet
  \pbuh said **When you dress and when you
  make _wuḍū_ , then begin with the right.** \[Abū Dāwūd (4141),
  al-Tirmidhī (1766), al-Nasāʾī (402). Al- Albaanee declares it to
  be _ṣaḥīḥ_\].

ECONOMIZING IN THE USE OF WATER AND NOT BEING WASTEFUL
======================================================

36. Anas \mabpwhim said: The Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) used to make _wuḍū_ with a mudd (of water) and make ghusl
  with a saa' or up to five mudds. \[Muslim (1/156) and others\]. A
  saa' is equal to four mudds. ( A mudd is that amount of water which
  is held by the two hands cupped together.)

 If you consider this _ḥadīth_ well, O my Muslim Brother, you would feel
 ashamed of what some people do these days - one of them opening the
 water tap and making _wuḍū_ and sometimes talking to his companion
 whilst the water is running out - what an excess in wastefulness! So
 he who does that should fear Allah and remember this _ḥadīth_ and keep
 it in mind and follow the Sunnah with regard to using the water
 sparingly and not being wasteful - and here the true following of the
 Prophet \pbuh is made clear and the true
 Muslim's belief. It is from the Sunnah for the Muslim who wishes to
 make _wuḍū_ to have with him a container large enough for a mudd of
 water - in order to force himself to return to the following of the
 Sunnah.

THE DU'AA AFTER THE _wuḍū_
=========================

36. 'Umar ibn al-Khattaab \mabpwhim said: the Emissary of Allah
  (sallallaahu 'alahi wa sallam) said **None of you makes _wuḍū_ and
  completes the _wuḍū_ then says:**

 **Ashhadu anlaa ilaaha illallaahu wahdahu laa shareekalahu washhadu
 anna Muhammadan ʿAbduhu wa rasooluhu** (I bear witness that none has
 the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His
 slave andMessenger) **except that all eight Gates of Paradise are
 opened for him - so that he enters by whichever he pleases.**
 \[Reported by Muslim (#234), Abū Dāwūd (no 169), al-Tirmidhī
 (#55), al-Nasāʾī (#148), Ibn Mājah (#470)\].
 
 And al-Tirmidhī adds an authentic addition to it:
 
 **Allahumma aj'alnee minat-tawwabeen waj'alnee minal mutatahhireen**
 (O Allah, make me one of those who constantly repents toYou and of
 those who purify themselves.) \[Declared as Sahih by al-Albānī\].

36. Abū Sa'eed al-Khudree \mabpwhim said the Emissary of Allah
  \pbuhsaid **Whoever makes _wuḍū_ then says
  upon finishing the _wuḍū_:**

 **Subhaanakallaahumma wa bihamdika ashhadu anlaa ilaaha illa anta
 astaghfiruka wa atoobu ilaika** (I declare You free from all defects
 my Lord and all praise belongs to you and I bear witness that there is
 none worthy of worship except You. I seek Your forgiveness and I turn
 to You) **It is written in a parchment, then sealed and is not opened
 till Judgement Day.** \[Reported by Ibn ar-Sunnee in 'Amal al Yaurn
 wal-l\~ilah, #30. Declared as _ṣaḥīḥ_ by al-Albānī\].

WASHING EACH BODY-PART ONCE
===========================

 68\. Ibn 'Abbaas \mabpwhim said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) made _wuḍū_ (washing each part) once. \[al-Bukhārī
 (al Fatḥ) 1/226\].

WASHING EACH BODY-PART TWICE
============================

59. ʿAbd Allāh ibn Zayd narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi
  wa sallam) made _wuḍū_ (washing each part) twice. \[al-Bukhārī (al
  Fatḥ) 1/226\].

WASHING EACH BODY-PART THRICE
=============================

59. In the _ḥadīth_ of ʿUthmān \mabpwhim recorded by
  al-Bukhārī and Muslim, he (sallallaahu 'alaihi wasallam) washed
  each of the parts three times.

 So from these ahaadeeth it becomes clear to us that, as is well-known
 to the large majority of scholars, washing each body-part once is
 obligatory - and the second and third washings are Sunnah - and it is
 better to do likewise following the Sunnah of the Prophet (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) \['al-Majmoo' of al-Nawawī, 1/229\].

THE DESIRABILITY OF MAKING _wuḍū_ FOR EACH PRAYER
================================================

 Al-Haafiz says in 'al Fatḥ' (1/172) in the question 'Making _wuḍū_
 without having broken it':

59. Anas \mabpwhim says: The Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) used to make _wuḍū_ for every prayer. I said: What had you
  (the Sahaabah) used to do? He said: One _wuḍū_ was sufficient for us
  till such time as we broke it.

 This _ḥadīth_ is an evidence that what is meant generally is the
 obligatory Prayer.
 
 Al-Tahaawee says: It may be that that was obligatory upon him
 \pbuh particularly - then was abrogated on
 the Day of Fatḥ by the _ḥadīth_ of Buraidah - meaning that which Muslim
 reports - that he \pbuh prayed all the
 Prayers on the Day of Fatḥ with one _wuḍū_ and that 'Umar
 
 \mabpwhim asked him about that so he (sallallaahu 'alaihi
 wa sallam) said **I did it deliberately.** Or it may be that he
 \pbuh used to do it out of desirability
 only, then feared that it might be thought to be obligatory and so
 left it to show the permissibility of that.
 
 I say: The result is that making _wuḍū_ for every Prayer is mustahabb
 and praying all of the Prayers with one _wuḍū_ is permissible - and
 Allah Knows best.

THE ONE WHO IS NOT SURE IF HE HAS BROKEN THE _wuḍū_ OR NOT RELIES UPON THAT WHICH HE IS CERTAIN OF
=================================================================================================

 If he who knows that he has made _wuḍū_ then is not sure that he has
 broken it - then his _wuḍū_ remains. And he who knows that he has done
 that which breaks _wuḍū_ and doubts when he has made _wuḍū_ thereafter
 then he does not have _wuḍū_ . In each case he relies upon that which
 he is certain of before that which he has doubt about - and he throws
 the doubt away. And this is the saying of the great majority of
 scholars - and it is the saying of Abū Hanifah, ash-Shaafi'ee and
 Aḥmad. \[_al-Mughnī_, 1/193, and \~iqh ul Awaaa'ee, 1/56\].

59. And the proof for this is what is established from Abū Hurayrah
  \mabpwhim who said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) said **If one of you feels something in his stomach and he
  isn't sure did anything (wind) come out of it or not - then let him
  not leave the mosque until he hears a sound or finds a smell.**
  \[Muslim (Sharh al-Nawawī, 4/51), 'Aaridat-ul-Ahwadhee Sharh ut-
  Tirmidhee, 1/79\].

 So the _ḥadīth_ is a proof that things remain upon their original state
 until there is a certainty of a change in that, and doubt does not
 harm that - so he who is sure of having made _wuḍū_ and thinks that he
 may have broken it, then he remains upon _wuḍū_ .

A MAN AND WOMAN'S WASHING FROM A SINGLE VESSEL
==============================================

59. Ibn 'Abbaas (radhiAllahu 'anhumaa) narrates that one of the wives
  of the Prophet \pbuh took a ghusl from
  Janaabah then saw the Emissary of Allah \pbuh about
  to take a ghusl from the water remaining - so she informed him that
  she had made ghusl therefrom - so Rasoolulah said **Nothing makes
  the water impure.** \[Reported by Abū Dāwūd (#67), and
  al-Nasāʾī (#326), and al-Tirmidhī who declared it to be hasan
  _ṣaḥīḥ_, and Ibn Mājah (#370)\].

 Ibn ʿAbd ul-Barr says: There is nothing in the Sharee'ah to prevent
 each of them washing with the water remaining from the other - either
 together or one after the other, and this is the saying of the
 scholars of the different lands and the great majority of scholars -
 and the ahaadeeth about it are Mutawaatir. (Al-Istidhkaar, 1/373).

MAKING _wuḍū_ AFTER EATING CAMEL MEAT
====================================

59. Jaabir ibn Samurah \mabpwhim narrates that a man asked
  the Emissary of Allah \pbuh: Should I make _wuḍū_
  because of the meat of sheep?

 He \pbuh said **If you wish make _wuḍū_ and
 if you wish then do not make _wuḍū_.** He said: Should I make _wuḍū_
 from the meat of the camel? He \pbuh said
 **Yes, make _wuḍū_ from the meat of the camel.** He asked: May I pray
 in sheep-pens? He \pbuh said **Yes.** He
 asked: May I pray in the stalls of camels? He (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
 sallam) said **#** \[Reported by Muslim, 1/189\].

DRYING THE BODY PARTS AFTER PURIFICATION
========================================

 'Uthman ibn 'Affaan, al- Hasan ibn 'Alee, Anas ibn Maalik, al-Hasan
 al-Basree, Ibn Seereen, 'Alqamah, al-Aswad, Masrooq, ad-Dahhaak,
 ʿAbd Allāh ibn al Haarith, Abū Ya'laa, Abūl Ahwas, Ash-Sha'bee,
 Ath-Thawree, Ishaaq, Ibn 'Umar in a narration, and Abū Hanifah,
 Maalik, Aḥmad, and the Shafi'ee Madhhab in one saying, all say that it
 is permissible after both _wuḍū_ and ghusl to dry the body-parts. And
 their evidence is what ʿĀʾishah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) reports - she
 said: the Emissary of Allah \pbuh had a cloth which he
 used to dry himself with after making _wuḍū_ . \[Reported by
 al-Tirmidhī who declared it to be da'eef\]. Then al Ainee states that
 al-Nasāʾī records it in 'al-Kunaa' with _ṣaḥīḥ_ _isnād_.
 
 I say: And it has other narrations which support and strengthen it.
 (See Fiqh al- Imam Sa'eed, 1/70). al-Albānī declares the _ḥadīth_ to
 be hasan. (_ṣaḥīḥ_ ul Jaami', 4706).

59. Salmaan al-Faarsee narrates that the Prophet (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) made _wuḍū_ , then turned up a woollen cloak he had and wiped
  his face with it. \[Reported by Ibn Mājah (#468)\]. In
  az-Zawaa'id it is said: Its _isnād_ is _ṣaḥīḥ_.

 I say: In its _isnād_ is al-Wadeen ibn 'Ataa who is sadooq but has a
 bad memory as al-Haafiz Ibn Ḥajr says in 'Taqreeb ut-Tahdheeb', so its
 _isnād_ is da'eef!! - but it is strengthened by the previous _ḥadīth_ of
 ʿĀʾishah to the level of hasan - and Allah Knows best.
 
 Some others hold it to be makrooh to dry the body-parts after
 Purification and their proof is:

59. What is established from Maimoonah (radhiAllahu'anhaa) who
  described the Prophet's \pbuh ghusl from
  Janaabah and said: Then I brought him a cloth but he refused it.
  \[al-Bukhārī, and Muslim - and the word is his\].

 The Final word: Is that drying the body-parts is one of the desirable
 actions as shown by the _ḥadīth_ of Aa'ishah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) - as
 for the saying that it is makrooh then that is not acceptable as the
 saying of Maimoonah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) "but he refused it" does not
 amount to the fact that it is makrooh - and Allah Knows best.

THOSE THINGS WHICH BREAK _wuḍū_
==============================

THAT WHICH COMES OUT FROM THE TWO PRIVATE PARTS (FRONT AND BACK):
=================================================================

 Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu
 'alaihi wa sallam) said **Allah does not accept the prayer of any one
 of you having committed hadath until he makes _wuḍū_.** \[al-Bukhārī
 (al Fatḥ, 1/206) and Muslim (#245)\].

59. al-Nawawī says in 'al-Majmoo' (2/3) as for that which comes out of
  the two private parts - then it breaks _wuḍū_ according to Allah
  ta'alas saying: Aw jaa'a ahadukum min al ghaa'it...: or one of you
  comes from offices of nature...\[Soorat-ul-Maa'idah 5:7\] along with
  his \pbuh saying **There is no _wuḍū_
  except from a sound or a smell.** \[_ṣaḥīḥ_ and has preceded (_ṣaḥīḥ_
  ul Jaarni' (7443)\].

 He adds: So that which comes out of the front or back part of a man or
 woman breaks the _wuḍū_ - whether excretion or urine or wind - or a
 worm or pus or blood or stones or anything else and there is no
 difference in that for something which happens normally or rarely.

(1) **SOUND SLEEP \[5\]**

<!-- -- 

59. 'Alee ibn Abi Taalib \mabpwhim said: the Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh said **The eye is the drawstring for
  the anus, so he who sleeps then let him make _wuḍū_.** \[Abū Dāwūd
  (#203), Ibn Mājah (#477), Aḥmad. Declared as _ṣaḥīḥ_ by
  al-Albānī\].

 In the _ḥadīth_ is an evidence that sleep does not in itself something
 that breaks _wuḍū_ , however the Purification is broken if it is
 possible for something to come out from the anus - however if that is
 restricted, e.g. by sitting flat on the earth, then that is not the
 case.

(1) **BECOMING UNCONSCIOUS - OTHER THAN SLEEP**

 That is the 'intellect' going away by any means because of insanirt or
 fainting or intoxication - as in this condition he does not know
 whether his _wuḍū_ is broken or not. This is the saying of the great
 majority of scholars. (Sharh _ṣaḥīḥ_ Muslim (4/74) and al-Mughnee
 (1/164)).

(1) Touching the Uncovered Private Parts 69. Abū Hurayrah (radhiAllahu
  'anhu) said: the Emissary of Allah \pbuh said **If
  one of you touches his penis and there is no veil between him and it
  nor any cover, then _wuḍū_ has become obligatory for him.**
  \[al-Haakim (1/138) and others\]. (al-Albānī says: _ḥadīth_
  _ṣaḥīḥ_.)

(2) **TOUCHING THE PENIS**

<!-- -- 

70. Busrah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) said: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu 'alaihi
  wa sallam) said **If one of you touches his penis then let him make
  _wuḍū_.** \[al-Tirmidhī (1/18) who said it is hasan _ṣaḥīḥ_. And also
  declared as _ṣaḥīḥ_ by Aḥmad, al- Bukhaaree and Ibn Ma'een (Lum'aat
  ut-Tanqeeh Sharh Mishkaat ul Masaabeeh, #319). Others also narrate
  it as authentic\].

71. Talq ibn 'Alee \mabpwhim said: the Emissary of Allah
  (sallallaahu'alaihi wa sallam) was asked about a man's touching his
  penis. Should he make _wuḍū_ ? He \pbuh
  said **And is it except a part of him?** \[al-Tirmidhī (#85) and
  he said: And this is the best of what is reported in this regard\].
  Al- Albaanee says: Its _isnād_ is _ṣaḥīḥ_, and this (the view that it
  doesn't break the _wuḍū_) is established as being that of a group of
  the Sahaabah, from them: Ibn Mas'ood, 'Ammaar ibn Yaasir, and
  because of these Imam Aḥmad gave the choice between this and the one
  before it. Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah harmonized the two
  carrying the first to mean if he touched it with desire and this
  upon the touching without desire - and there is in this _ḥadīth_ that
  which gives that impression and it is his (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa
  sallam) saying 'a part of him'. \[Al-Mishkaat al Masaabeeh, notes on
  nos.3 19 and 320\].

<!-- -- 

(1) **TOUCHING A WOMAN WITH DESIRE**

<!-- -- 

70. A man's touching a woman without desire does not break the _wuḍū_ .
  ʿĀʾishah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa) says: the Emissary of Allah (sallallaahu
  'alaihi wa sallam) prayed and I was lying in front of him as in
  front of a Janaazah, so when he wished to prostrate I pulled up my
  leg. \[al-Bukhārī and Muslim\].

71. And in the same way a woman's touching a man without desire does not
  break _wuḍū_ as is established from ʿĀʾishah (radhiAllahu 'anhaa):
  I didn't find the Prophet \pbuh one night
  so I tried to find him with my hand - and my hand fell upon his feet
  which were raised up as he was making prostration. \[Muslim (3/203)
  and al-Nasāʾī (l/101)\].

 So we see from these two _ḥadīth_ that merely touching does not break
 the _wuḍū_ - and Allah Knows best.
 
 The author of'at-Ta'leeqaat us-Salafiyyah' upon Sunan of al-Nasāʾī
 (1/23) says concerning "he pushed me with his foot": It is well-known
 that that is a touching without desire. And so the author uses it as a
 proof that touching without desire does not break the _wuḍū_ . As for
 the touching with desire - its proof is that the _wuḍū_ is not broken
 until a proof is established that it does indeed break it - and this
 is enough of a proof to show that it doesn't break the _wuḍū_ for the
 one who holds that view - and above and beyond that is a further proof
 that it doesn't break the _wuḍū_ is the _ḥadīth_ of kissing - as
 normally kissing is not free from touching with desire.
 
 The author of 'Aun al Ma'bood' (1/69) says regarding her saying "he
 kissed me and did not make _wuḍū_"' - It contains a proof that touching
 a woman does not break the _wuḍū_ as kissing is part of touching and
 the Prophet \pbuh did not make _wuḍū_ (before
 praying). And this (that touching a woman even with desire doesn't
 break the _wuḍū_ ) is the saying of 'Alee and Ibn 'Abbaas and 'Ataa ibn
 Taawoos, and Abū Hanifah and Sufyaan ath-Thawree. And this _ḥadīth_ is
 (in itself) da'eef but is supported by other narrations. And it is
 mursal - however ad- Daaraqutnee joins it - and it is (therefore) an
 authentic (_ṣaḥīḥ_) _ḥadīth_ inshaaAllah. (See Nasb ur Raayah, l/70).
 
 The author of _al-Mughnī_ (1/190) says: The touching is not in itself
 something which breaks _wuḍū_ but breaks _wuḍū_ as it leads to
 prostratic fluid or semen being emitted - so the condition which leads
 to breaking of the _wuḍū_ is considered - and that is when there is
 desire.
 
 Summary: That when a man and woman are safe from anything being
 emitted which breaks _wuḍū_ - then their _wuḍū_ is not broken; and it is
 preferable to be on the safe side, as they may not be safe from such
 emissions in the condition of desire - and Allah Knows best.
 
 **CONCLUSION**
 
 This is what Allah ta'ala has made easy for us to gather together
 about the _wuḍū_ and its rulings, so we hope from Allah the Most High,
 the All-Powerful, that we have been able to do justice to the subject
 - and we hope that any scholarly solicitous brother who comes across
 anything in our booklet which is incorrect to cover up and give
 sincere advice. And it is Allah who grants success.
