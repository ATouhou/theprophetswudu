# Introduction

Verily all praise is for Allah, we praise Him and seek His aid and ask for His forgiveness, and we seek refuge with Allah from the evils of ourselves and our evil actions. Whomever Allah guides there is none who can misguide him, and whomever Allah misguides there is none who can guide him, and I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah Alone, having no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.

«O mankind! Revere your Guardian-Lord, Who created you from a single person, created, of like nature his mate, and from them twain scattered countless men and women; revere Allah, through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and (revere) the wombs (that bore you): for Allah ever watches over you.» (Sūrah al-Nisā, 1)

«O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islam.» (Sūrah Āl ʿImrān, 102)

«O you who believe! Fear Allah, and (always) say a word did to the right that He may make your conduct whole and sound and forgive you your sins: He who obeys Allah and His Messenger, has already attained the highest achievement.» (Sūrah al-Aḥzāb, 70--71)

As for what follows: Verily the most truthful speech is the Word of Allah and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad \pbuh, and the worst of affairs are the novelties and
every novelty is an innovation and every innovation is a going astray and every going astray is in the Fire.

I desired to write this as a completion for the treatises which are in circulation amongst the people today---about the different fields---especially of worship such as prayer and fasting, etc. which have made easier that which is difficult as regards religious rulings and being guided thereby, as it maybe difficult these days for some to read, research and extract these rulings from their places within the
source books, either because of the ignorance of the Muslims or laziness or other worldly problems. I sincerely advise all the Muslims to read and research until they come to know and understand their true _Dīn_.

I wished to write this in order to complete the series of the types of worship, especially since no one has particularized this topic in a treatise---except what occurs within the books of reference as we have explained---but I have not found this in the form of a treatise.

My method for this treatise has been not to quote except what is authentic from the _ḥadīth_ of the Messenger of Allah \pbuh---if Allah wishes---ordering it according to the order of the _Wuḍū_ of the Messenger of Allah \pbuh, and I have commented on some of the points about which there is difference of opinion, stating that which is correct therefrom in our view after replying to the other opinions.

I ask Allah to guide us to that which is proper. Verily He is the One having authority over that and having the Power to do so.


# The Definition of Wuḍū

## Arabic Language

_Wuḍū_ is the action, and _Waḍū_ the water used therefore---and it is also a verbal noun; or they are two forms of the same word, both meaning the verbal-noun and maybe both referring also to the water used.
 
## Shariah
 
_Wuḍū_ is using clean and cleansing (_ṭuhūr_) water upon certain body parts as Allah has prescribed and explained.


# The Prescription of Wuḍū in the Kitāb and Sunnah

Allah says,

> O Ye who believe! When ye prepare for prayer, wash your faces,
> and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with water);
> and (wash) your feet to the ankles.
> (Sūrah al-Māʾidah, Q5:7)

1. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “The _ṣalāh_ of anyone of you breaching purification is not accepted unless he makes wuḍū.”[^1]

2. Ibn ʿUmar \mabpwthemtwo said: Indeed I heard the Emissary of Allah \pbuh say, “Allah does not accept _ṣalāh_ without purification, nor _ṣadaqah_ from illegally attained wealth.”[^2]

3. Ibn ʿAbbās \mabpwthemtwo said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Verily I have been ordered to make _wuḍū_ when I stand for _ṣalāh_.”[^3]

4. Abū Saʿīd \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “The key to _ṣalāh_ is purification, its _taḥrīm_[^4] is the _takbīr_ and its _taḥlīl_[^5] is the giving of _salām_.”[^6]

# The Excellence of Wuḍū

1. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh said, “Shall I not guide you to that
  by which Allah wipes away the sins and raises the ranks? They
  said: Certainly O Emissary of Allah! He said Completing the
  _wuḍū_ when it is a hardship, and many steps to the mosques and
  waiting for the [next] prayer after the prayer, that is
  _al-Ribāṭ_ (defending the frontiers); that is _al-Ribāṭ_; that is
  _al-Ribāṭ_.”[^7]

2. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim reports that Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh said, “When the Muslim (or
  'Believing') servant makes _wuḍū_ and washes his face then the sin of
  everything he looked at with his eye comes away with the water, or
  with the last drop of the water, and when he washes his hands then
  the sin of everything he stretched out his hands to comes away with
  the water, or with the last drop of the water. And when he washes
  his feet every sin which his feet walked towards comes away with the
  water or with the last drop of the water---so that he leaves clean
  (clear/pure) from sins.”[^8]

3. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim reports that Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh came to the graveyard and said, “Peace be upon you, dwelling of Believing People and we will (all)
  if Allah wills join you soon. I would have liked to have seen our
  brothers!” They said, “Are we not your brothers, O Emissary of
  Allah?” He \pbuh said, “You are my Companions and our brothers are those
  who have not yet come!” They said, “How will you know those who have
  not yet come from your _Ummah_, O Emissary of Allah?” He said, “Have
  you not seen that if a man had a horse with a white blaze and hoof
  along with a totally jet-black horse, then would he not know his
  horse?” They said, “Certainly, O Emissary of Allah.” He said, “So
  they will come with white blazes and marks from the _wuḍū_ and I am
  present before them at the Hand (_water-tank_). Indeed men will be
  driven away from my _water-tank_ as the lost camel is driven away
  from their gathering place. ‘Come on.’ So it will be said: ‘Indeed
  they have made changes after you,’ so I will say, ‘Be off, be off.’”[^9]

4. Abū Umāmah \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “When a Muslim makes _wuḍū_ the sins he has
  committed come away from his hearing and from his sight and from his
  hand and from his feet, so when he sits he sits down having been
  forgiven.”[^10]

5. Abū Mālik al-Ashʿarī \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Purification is half of Īmān;
  and _alḥamdulillāh_ fills the Scales; and _subḥānAllāh_ and
  _alḥamdulillāh_ fill whatever is between the heaven and the
  earth; and _Ṣalāh_ is a light; and _Ṣadaqah_ is a clear proof; and _Ṣabr_
  (patience) is a shining light; and the Quran is a proof for or
  against you. Every person starts the day dealing for his own soul so
  he either sets it free or destroys it.”[^11]

6. ʿUthmān \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Whoever makes _wuḍū_ and makes it well, his sins
  come out from his body, even coming out from under his nails.”[^12]

7. ʿUthmān \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Whoever makes _wuḍū_ like this---then all of his
  previous sins are forgiven---and his _Ṣalāh_ and his walking to the
  masjid are above and beyond that.”[^13]

8. Ibn 'Umar \mabpwthemtwo said: The Emissary of Allah said, “When one of you makes _wuḍū_ and
  makes it well, then goes out to the masjid---having no purpose
  except _Ṣalāh_---then his left foot continues to wipe away his evil
  deeds and his right foot continually writes for him good deeds until
  he enters the masjid. And if the people knew what there was in the
  night prayer and Subh prayers, then they would come to them even if
  they had to crawl.[^14]

9. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Whoever makes _wuḍū_ and makes it well then
  goes out---and then finds that the people have finished the _Ṣalāh_---
  then Allah gives him the same reward as one who had prayed it along
  with the people without diminishing any of their reward.[^15]

10. Zayd ibn Khālid al-Juhanī \mabpwhim relates that the
  Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Whoever makes _wuḍū_
  and makes it well, then prays two _rakʿahs_ not letting his mind
  wander in them---then Allah forgives him all of his previous
  sins.”[^16]

11. ʿUqbah ibn ʿĀmir \mabpwhim said: The Emissary of Allah
  \pbuh said, “Whoever makes _wuḍū_ and makes
  it well, then prays two _rakʿahs_ concentrating therein with his heart
  and his face---then Paradise is obligatory for him.”[^17]

12. ʿUthmān \mabpwhim said: I heard the Emissary of Allah \pbuh say, “Whoever makes _wuḍū_ for _Ṣalāh_ and
  completes the _wuḍū_---then walks to the obligatory _Ṣalāh_ and prays
  it with the people---or with the congregation---or in the mosque---then Allah forgives his sins.”[^18]

13. ʿAlī \mabpwhim relates that the Emissary of Allah \pbuh said, “Completing the _wuḍū_ when it is a
  hardship, and walking to the masjid, and waiting for the next prayer
  after the previous one (greatly) washes away the sins.”[^19]

14. Humrān ibn Abān relates that ʿUthmān asked for water to make
  _wuḍū_---then he mentioned how the Emissary of Allah \pbuh made _wuḍū_.
  Then he \mabpwhim said, “The Emissary of Allah \pbuh said at the end of the _ḥadīth_, 
  ‘Whoever makes _wuḍū_ in the same way that I have just made _wuḍū_ then
  stands up and prays two _rakʿahs_, not thinking of other things, then
  his previous sins are forgiven.’”[^20]

# The Components of Wuḍū

## Al-Niyyah (Intention)

This is the firm resolve of the heart to perform
_wuḍū_ in obedience to the order of Allah \swt and His Emissary
\pbuh. Ibn Taymiyyah \mercy said in _Majmūʿah al-Rasāʾil al-Kubrā_ (1/243):
“The place of the _niyyah_ is the heart and not the tongue in all forms of
_ʿibādah_---and that is agreed upon by all the Muslim scholars---Purification,
_Ṣalāh_, _Zakāt_, _Ṣawm_, _Ḥajj_, _ʿItq_ (freeing of slaves), _Jihād_, etc.
If he were to express with his tongue other than that which he intended in
his heart---then what he intended is counted, not what he said. If he voiced the
intention with his tongue and the intention was not in his heart, that
will not count---by total agreement of all the scholars of Islam---so
the _niyyah_ is the firm intention and resolve itself.”

As the Emissary of Allah \pbuh himself explained in the _ḥadīth_ narrated by ʿUmar \mabpwhim
in the _Ṣaḥīḥayn_, “Verily the actions are by intention and there is for everyone only
what he intended...”[^21]

## Al-Tasmiyyah (Mentioning Allah's Name)

1. Abū Hurayrah \mabpwhim said that the Emissary of Allah \pbuh
  said “There is no _wuḍū_ for him who does not mention Allah's name
  upon it.”[^22]

    Imam Aḥmad in one of his two sayings is of the opinion that it is
    obligatory in _wuḍū_, _ghusl_, and _tayammum_. He was followed in this
    opinion by Abū Bakr, and it is the saying of al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī and
    Imam Isḥāq---as reported by Ibn Qudāmah in _al-Mughnī_ (1/84), and
    their proof is this _ḥadīth_.
 
    Ibn Qudāmah adds in _al-Mughnī_: If we take the saying that it is
    obligatory,then the _wuḍū_ of one who deliberately leaves it is not
    correct as he has left an obligatory duty in Purification---just as
    if he had left the intention; and if he left it forgetfully then his
    purification is correct. And this is the saying that we regard as
    being correct.

    As for Ibn Taymiyyah \mercy, he held it to be obligatory if the
    related _ḥadīth_ was authentic---as occurs in his _Kitāb al-Īmān_---
    and the _ḥadīth_ is authentic, so therefore his opinion is that it is
    obligatory.

2. Al-Bukhārī and Muslim report from Anas \mabpwhim that some of the
    Companions of the Prophet \pbuh sought water for _wuḍū_, so the Emissary
    of Allah \pbuh said “Does any of you have water?” So he put his hand
    into the water and said “Make _wuḍū_ in the name of Allah.” And I
    saw the water coming out from between his fingers until they all
    made _wuḍū_.

    Thābit said: “I said to Anas \mabpwhim, ‘How many were
    there?’ He said, ‘About seventy.’”[^23]
 
    As for the proof for that which we have stated---it is his \pbuh
    saying “Make _wuḍū_ in the name of Allah.” As for those who say that
    it is only _sunnah muʾakkadah_, then they base that upon the relative
    _ḥadīth_ being weak. However since the _ḥadīth_ is _ṣaḥīḥ_ as we have
    explained, then there remains no proof for them and the proof is with
    us, and Allah Knows Best.
 
So it is therefore obligatory as we have shown, however the one who
forgets should mention Allah's name when he remembers.
