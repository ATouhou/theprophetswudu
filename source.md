# Introduction

Verily all praise is for Allah, we praise Him and seek His aid and ask for His forgiveness, and we seek refuge with Allah from the evils of ourselves and our evil actions. Whomever Allah guides there is none who can misguide him, and whomever Allah misguides there is none who can guide him, and I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah Alone, having no partner, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.

«O mankind! Revere your Guardian-Lord, Who created you from a single person, created, of like nature his mate, and from them twain scattered countless men and women; revere Allah, through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and (revere) the wombs (that bore you): for Allah ever watches over you.» (Sūrah al-Nisā, 1)

«O you who believe! Fear Allah as He should be feared, and die not except in a state of Islam.» (Sūrah Āl ʿImrān, 102)

«O you who believe! Fear Allah, and (always) say a word did to the right that He may make your conduct whole and sound and forgive you your sins: He who obeys Allah and His Messenger, has already attained the highest achievement.» (Sūrah al-Aḥzāb, 70--71)

As for what follows: Verily the most truthful speech is the Word of Allah and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam), and the worst of affairs are the novelties and
every novelty is an innovation and every innovation is a going astray and every going astray is in the Fire.

I desired to write this as a completion for the treatises which are in circulation amongst the people today---about the different fields---especially of worship such as prayer and fasting, etc. which have made easier that which is difficult as regards religious rulings and being guided thereby, as it maybe difficult these days for some to read, research and extract these rulings from their places within the
source books, either because of the ignorance of the Muslims or laziness or other worldly problems. I sincerely advise all the Muslims to read and research until they come to know and understand their true _Dīn_.

I wished to write this in order to complete the series of the types of worship, especially since no one has particularized this topic in a treatise---except what occurs within the books of reference as we have explained---but I have not found this in the form of a treatise.

My method for this treatise has been not to quote except what is authentic from the _ḥadīth_ of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam)---if Allah wishes---ordering it according to the order of the _Wuḍū_ of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam), and I have commented on some of the points about which there is difference of opinion, stating that which is correct therefrom in our view after replying to the other opinions.

I ask Allah to guide us to that which is proper. Verily He is the One having authority over that and having the Power to do so.


# The Definition of Wuḍū

_Wuḍū_ in the Arabic Language:

_Wuḍū_ is the action, and _Waḍū_ the water used therefore---and it is also a verbal noun; or they are two forms of the same word, both meaning the verbal-noun and maybe both referring also to the water used.
 
_Wuḍū_ in the Shariah:
 
_Wuḍū_ is using clean and cleansing (_ṭuhūr_) water upon certain body parts as Allah has prescribed and explained.
